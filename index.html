	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Welcome to the first installment of <strong>The Elements of Style in Ruby</strong>.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll start off with something pretty generic, that&#8217;s not specific to
Ruby at all - the maximum line length that&#8217;s acceptable in our code.</p>

<p>The guide currently states:</p>

<blockquote><p>Limit lines to 80 characters.</p></blockquote>

<p>How did we get here?</p>

<p>Due to limitations of the old 80-column computer screens for many
years 80 (or 79 depending on your preferences) columns has been the
gold standard for maximum line length in most languages. That was the
bulk of the reasoning behind the rule. There was also fact that Ruby&#8217;s
main competitor Python upholds the same line-length limit.</p>

<p>Many would argue that such a restriction does not make sense with the
advances in computer displays in recent years - after all a full hd
computer display would give you much more columns to play with. Why
not go with no limit what-so-ever? That would be simple, right?</p>

<p>Wrong! We should definitely have a limit - that&#8217;s beyond any
doubt. It&#8217;s common knowledge that humans read much faster vertically,
than horizontally. Try to read the source code of something with
200-character lines and you&#8217;ll come to acknowledge that. On the other
hand the problem with aggressive line-length limits is that they often
come at the expense of code readability - programmers start using less
descriptive variable and method names, span long expressions over
multiple lines, etc. A balance has to struck somewhere.</p>

<p>Ruby has generally favored succinctness (not to be confused with
terseness) and 80 columns are generally not some attainable goal as
many of you probably already know (Java developers on the other hand
can barely fit something meaningful in less that 100 or even 120
characters per line). Short, but descriptive names, proper
abstractions, judicious nesting and heredocs certainly help to keep
the lines short in Ruby.</p>

<p>And what of the benefit for our efforts? Apart from enabling faster
scanning though the code, shorter lines allow you to keep two or more
files opened side by side in your IDE or text editor, which is often
pretty handy. On a <code>1366*768</code> screen (somewhat unfortunately - the
most popular today) - you won&#8217;t be able to achieve this with
normal-sized fonts and lines longer than 80-90 characters.</p>

<p>That said, maybe 80 columns is a bit too restrictive and a 100 columns
limit strikes a better balance between reading speed, code readability
and practical considerations like have two files opened side-by-side.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts! Feel free to leave a comment here or
ping me on <a href="http://twitter.com/bbatsov">Twitter</a>.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide">The Ruby Style Guide</a> is
nearing its second birthday. The project has gained more attention and
more traction than I could have imagined. For the millionth time I was
amazed by the fantastic Ruby developers around the world.</p>

<p>The project has also steadily evolved:</p>

<ul>
<li>it covers more and more aspects of programming in Ruby</li>
<li>it features many more code examples</li>
<li>it is now translated in several languages</li>
<li>it gave birth to the automated static code analyzer <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">RuboCop</a></li>
<li>it has become the basis for hundreds of slightly modified internal project or company style guides</li>
</ul>


<p>One common criticism for the Ruby style guide is that it doesn&#8217;t
feature extensive rationale about most of the rules in it. That&#8217;s
deliberate - even now the document is pretty intimidating. If we were
to delve into the reasoning behind each and every rule, the guide&#8217;s
size might come close to that of a small book.</p>

<p>I do, however, feel that the rationale behind some of the rules is
important. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ll be starting a series of <em>N</em> posts devoted
to the topic. I&#8217;ll try to cover as many of the rules as I can - from
the more straightforward ones like <em>maximum line-length</em>, to the most
controversial ones like <em>the use of single-quoted strings when possible</em>.</p>

<p>Keep an eye for the installments in the series here and on
<a href="http://twitter.com/bbatsov">Twitter</a>. I&#8217;m looking forward to many
interesting discussions with you!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">RuboCop</a> 0.8.0 is out!</p>

<p>While the version bump is minor, this release represents an almost
total rewrite of the code. We&#8217;ve moved away from MRI&#8217;s <code>Ripper</code> parser
and ported RuboCop to <a href="https://github.com/whitequark">Peter Zotov</a>&#8217;s
fantastic <a href="https://github.com/whitequark/parser">Parser</a>.</p>

<p>What does this mean for users of RuboCop? It means that now both
Rubinius and JRuby are supported (in 1.9 and 2.0 modes). I&#8217;d say this
is kind of a big deal! The support for the them should be considered
beta at this point, since they have not yet received extensive field
testing.</p>

<p>And what does the change mean for developers? It&#8217;s now a lot easier to
comprehend RuboCop&#8217;s source code, lowering the bar for contributions
immensely.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s coming down the road for 0.9.0? We have two big changes
planned - providing an auto-fix functionality(meaning RuboCop will be
able to fix on its own some of the problems detected) and providing
more precise diagnostic messages(a-la <code>clang</code>).</p>

<p>The changelog for 0.8.0 is available <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">here</a>.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Several months passed since I stated my intent
<a href="articles/2013/01/27/the-wikemacs-experiment-is-over-long-live-emacswiki/">to shutdown WikEmacs</a>. While
I still consider the project a failed experiment and stand by
everything I wrote in that post, I have received since lots of messages from
people who were sad to see WikEmacs go. One person in particular,
<a href="https://twitter.com/holocronweaver">Jesse Johnson</a>, was committed to
seeing the project move forward and offered to take over its stewardship.</p>

<p>In the end I&#8217;ve decided that in spirit of the FOSS ideals I don&#8217;t have
the right to take away something people like and want to use(especially
given the fact that they contributed most of the content there) and
handed over the domain and the data to Jesse.</p>

<p><a href="http://wikemacs.org/index.php/Main_Page">WikEmacs</a> has been running
for a couple of weeks now under his management and will continue to
exist for a long time. If you liked the project I guess this is a good
moment to show you love and spread the word.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/articles/2013/04/23/rubocop-0-dot-6-0-released/">RuboCop 0.6.0 Released</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">RuboCop</a> 0.6.0 was just released!
It&#8217;s RuboCop&#8217;s biggest and most ambitious release yet.  Here&#8217;s the
highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>15 new cops(checks)</li>
<li>Support for disabling cops locally in a file with <code>rubocop:disable</code> comments</li>
<li>Half a dozen bugs squashed</li>
<li>Small improvements across the board</li>
</ul>


<p>I guess the support for disabling cops locally deserves a bit of special treatment.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s the basics - you&#8217;re now allowed to enable/disable certain cops
(checks) and to alter their behavior if they accept any parameters.</p>

<p>One or more individual cops can be disabled locally in a section of a
file by adding a comment such as:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># rubocop:disable LineLength, StringLiterals</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">[.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># rubocop:enable LineLength, StringLiterals</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can also disable <em>all</em> cops with:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># rubocop:disable all</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">[.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># rubocop:enable all</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>One or more cops can be disabled on a single line with an end-of-line
comment:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># rubocop:disable AvoidFor</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can see all the gory details in the
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a>. I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy RuboCop 0.6.0!</p>
