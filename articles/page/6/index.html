	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p><a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> is an amazing cloud hosting solution. It&#8217;s extremely well
documented, very easy to start with, very stable and provides you with
the option to use free hosting for some small applications.</p>

<p>While Heroku is generally known as a Ruby on Rails hosting company,
since their acquisition by SalesForce last year, they&#8217;ve expanded
their deployment options a lot. Currently Ruby, Java, Scala, Clojure,
Python and Node.js are all officially supported (on the Cedar Celadon
stack) and more will probably come very soon.</p>

<p>All of our company&#8217;s applications are using
<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails 3.1.x</a> and are
targeting the <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">MRI 1.9.2</a>. Those two facts are
the reason that we&#8217;re using Heroku&#8217;s
<a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar">Celadon Cedar</a> deployment
stack. Celadon Cedar is currently in beta, but it offer a lot of
benefit over the old (stable) Bamboo stack (which also support Rails
3.1 apps and Ruby 1.9.2). For instance - Celadon is aware of the Rails
3.1 asset pipeline and can compile the assets automatically when you
deploy your apps to Heroku. With Bamboo you have to precompile the
resources, which is a very tedious task.</p>

<p>While our experience with Heroku has been very positive in
general, we&#8217;ve hit some bumps along the road, so I&#8217;ve decided to share
some of the problems and their solutions with everyone.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>Last month I&#8217;ve blogged about the
<a href="/articles/2011/08/19/a-peek-at-emacs24/">exciting things are coming up in Emacs 24</a>. What
I failed to mention originally is that altough Emacs 24 is slated for
a Spring 2012 (tentatively) release there is no real reason not to start using it
now. You should also keep in mind that it&#8217;s feature complete since it
officially entered the feature freeze of its development cycle in July 2011.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using Emacs 24 for several months now and it has been
nothing but rock solid. I guess the only real obstacle currently is
that the way to obtain Emacs 24 is not particularly straightfoward/clear,
hence this post.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll discuss here the installation and initial configuration of Emacs
24 on OSX, GNU/Linux and Windows.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve decided to have a look at the current development
version of Emacs - namely Emacs 24. I was quite impressed with the work done
by the development team so far so I decided to share some of the cool things
I&#8217;ve found in Emacs 24.</p>

<p>It seems to me that this will be the most important Emacs release in
quite some time.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve recently been using Debian a lot (mostly Debian Wheezy (aka
testing)), So I&#8217;ve decided to adapt my
<a href="/Linux/Fedora/2011/05/31/fedora-15-tips.html">Fedora 15 post installation setup &amp; tips</a>
article for Debian. Here are some of the common things I add to a
typical &#8220;graphical desktop&#8221; Debian installation as well as some tips
and tricks that you&#8217;ll hopefully find useful. Btw, I highly recommend
you to use the <a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/daily-builds/daily/arch-latest/amd64/iso-cd/debian-testing-amd64-netinst.iso">netinstall Debian distribution</a> - that way you&#8217;ll get an
up-to-date installation immediately and you won&#8217;t have to download
huge installation images.</p>

<p>This article will be of use mostly to people using Debian as a desktop
OS (with GNOME as their desktop environment) - it doesn&#8217;t discuss any
server configurations.</p>

    <article class="post">
	<h1 class="title"><a href="/articles/2011/06/19/django-vs-rails/">Django 1.3 vs Rails 3: A Not So Final Showdown</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve recently started a new job at an American start-up company. My
position in the company is the one of Technical Lead - the person responsible for
the selection of technologies around which the projects are being
built. Since we&#8217;ll be doing mostly web development we&#8217;ve had a long
kick-off discussion with the company&#8217;s CTO about the direction which we should
initially take. He had PHP in mind, but I convinced him that Ruby or
Python would make much better platforms for our futures apps. So he
tasked me to research the two leading frameworks in the Ruby and
Python land - namely Ruby on Rails 3 and Django 1.3. I had a week to
prepare some prototypes with both and create on overview for my
boss. I had some experience with Rails 2 a few years back and I have
fairly decent knowledge of Ruby. My Python is not as fluent
(admittedly), but still - I&#8217;ve played a lot with Python
recently. Django, however, was completely new to me. In this article
I&#8217;ll try to compare the frameworks in a totally friendly way; if
you&#8217;ve expected an epic flame war post you may very well stop reading
here. I&#8217;m obviously no Rails/Django guru, so if I&#8217;ve
written something that is wrong - please feel free to correct me.</p>

<p>Please, keep in mind that a short comparison article cannot even begin
to scratch the immense power and complexity of such frameworks. The overview,
that you&#8217;ll find here is a bit on the superficial side, but it should
give you enough pointers to get you started.</p>

<p>Hopefully this article will be useful to people that are in the same
boat as was - picking between Rails and Django.</p>
