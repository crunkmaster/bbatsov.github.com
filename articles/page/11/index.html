		<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>

<p><em>This post is a bona fide rant. It tells how a hardcore Linux user
(me) decided to abandon Linux as a desktop platform and the reasons
behind this decision. It might provoke some controversy, but
I frankly don&#8217;t care.</em></p>

<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m generally known as one of the biggest supporters of GNU/Linux,
I&#8217;ve taught courses on Linux administration, I&#8217;ve spoken at Linux
conferences and I naturally use Linux as my primary desktop on all my
machines. Well, that last part is not so true anymore. Here the story
begins&#8230;</p>

<h2>The background</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using GNU/Linux exclusively for 8 years now. I&#8217;ve spent a
lot of time with Fedora, Gentoo and Arch Linux. I use it at home, I
use it at work and along the way I&#8217;ve converted many Windows users to
Linux. I&#8217;ve lived through a lot of driver and software problems
with Linux, hoping that the day would come when it will become a
first-class citizen of the desktop operating systems town. Alas, this
day never came and probably never will.</p>

<p>My patience ended this week and I&#8217;ll be gradually moving all my
desktop machines back to Windows. What caused me to take such drastic
course of action? I&#8217;ve bought myself a new ThinkPad T520 laptop,
powered by Nvidia&#8217;s Optimus GPU switching technology - when the GPU
load is low it uses the built-in Sandy Bridge GPU, when it gets higher
- it switches to the discrete NVS 4200M GPU. Needless to say - this
  technology is not supported under Linux, but I was prepared to live
  without it. After all both Intel and Nvidia are known to have decent
  Linux drivers so I was about to try both GPU and select the one with
  the better performance. All I had to do was pick a shiny new
  distribution to power my mobile powerhouse&#8230;</p>

<h2>The Distribution</h2>

<p>I love Fedora - always have, always will. They constantly deliver to
the end users the cutting edge in Linux technologies (both desktop and
server), so it&#8217;s naturally my distro of choice (I&#8217;m quite fond of
cutting edge tech). I installed on the new
laptop the latest Fedora 15 with GNOME 3.0 and here the problems
started. GNOME 3 requires 3d acceleration to work properly - a
reasonable requirement these days, at least on an operating system with
normal video drivers.</p>

<p>The Intel driver sucked so bad that I got constant screen corruption
and hang-ups. Too bad, because I preferred to use the Intel GPU since
I mostly work on the laptop. The open source Nvidia driver nouveau
doesn&#8217;t support the NVS 4200, so I was forced to install the
proprietary driver. It ran OK initially, but after some time my system
just started to freeze while waiting for Plymouth (probably after some
kernel update, which I didn&#8217;t notice). I could have tried the usual
tricks and fixed the problem, but at this point I finally realized how
idiotic it was of me to keep using Linux for a desktop OS after all
the shit I&#8217;ve endured and the time I&#8217;ve wasted dealing with stuff that
should have been &#8220;just working&#8221;. I just want to get some work done, I
don&#8217;t want to waste my time debugging all kind of crap.</p>

<h2>The Shit I endured</h2>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>

<p><em>I&#8217;ve endured this Shit over the aforementioned period of 8
years. Some of the problems here have been alleviated (like
ethernet/wireless support) and some manifest mainly with newer
hardware (released in the past 6-12 months). Many of the problems,
unfortunately manifest on all kind of hardware no matter how old.</em></p>

<p><strong>Non-existing ethernet/wireless drivers</strong> - not so common today, but
  try remembering the time circa 2005</p>

<p><strong>Non-existing/crappy audio drivers</strong> - got an X-Fi 5 years ago, ALSA
  driver was released 3-4 years later and was total piece of garbage,
  OSS driver was barely usable. I don&#8217;t even get me started on USB
  audio support - what a joke&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Lamest video card drivers ever</strong> - most video card drivers for Linux
  are so bad I cannot even watch tear-free video. Nvidia have the only
  decent video driver, but it&#8217;s far from perfect either - no KMS, poor
  2D acceleration. AMD&#8217;s drivers are a punishment from the Lord and
  Intel&#8217;s constantly &#8220;evolving&#8221; drivers are barely usable most of the
  time. The video card drivers made me buy and HD media player and an
  PS3 (for which I&#8217;m thankful), but I have to ask myself - why suffer
  all this shit instead of getting a normal desktop OS like OS X or
  Windows? Did I love Linux that much? Did I believe that much it&#8217;s
  desktop day would come? What an idiot I was.</p>

<p><strong>Lack of printer drivers</strong> - that&#8217;s a funny one. Often printers
  listed as having Linux drivers are mostly unusable. The printer that
  own is listed as having a &#8220;perfect&#8221; Linux compatability in
  openprinting.org. If this is perfect I cannot begin to imagine what
  is &#8220;poor&#8221; compatibility.</p>

<p><strong>Crappiest suspend/resume support</strong> - laptop goes to sleep, but
  doesn&#8217;t wake up. Wireless dies after wake up. Suspend/resume used to
  be something mythical to most Linux users. Recently the situation
  has improved a bit it&#8217;s still light years away from what you get
  with Windows/OSX.</p>

<p><strong>Poor power management</strong> - my older laptop&#8217;s battery lasted several
  weeks while sleeping when I was using Windows on it. When I replaced
  it with Linux the battery was being drained in 2 days while the
  laptop was sleeping (and I had to wait about half a year for a set
  of wireless and video drivers that actually made sleep a
  possibility)&#8230; I&#8217;ve noticed that as far as dynamic power
  management is concerned Windows generally managed to squeeze more time
  out of the battery, while at the same time my rig generated less
  heat (dynamic fan control is another weakness of Linux).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll stop writing about the driver problems now, because they affect
so many thing. Even my fairly advanced mouse is missing some functions
in Linux. I&#8217;m not even mentioning the things like support for &#8220;Turbo
Memory&#8221;, Optimus, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Lack of decent office software</strong> - call it OpenOffice.org and don&#8217;t
  insult it anymore&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Problematic sound architecture</strong> - let me be completely blunt -
  everything sound related in Linux sucks - OSS, ALSA, PulseAudio (the
  sucker king). From a technical standpoint OSS never actually sucked,
  but since it wasn&#8217;t picked up by the community the project fell
  into oblivion. How many of you have enjoy Dolby Digital or DTS sound
  from their Linux boxes?</p>

<p><strong>Poor flash support</strong> - should I explain? Have you tried it on a 64
  bit distro? Do I hate it? Sure. Do I hope HTML5 will kill it?
  Sure. Do I need it? Sure. You think your video drivers work OK under
  Linux? Have you tried playing a HD video clip in youtube with flash
  player at full-screen? Very few Linux video drivers handle this task properly&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Poor skype support</strong> - Same story as with flash. I keep dreaming of
  a world with more intelligent users where GTalk has a conference
  mode and everybody&#8217;s using it instead of skype.</p>

<p><strong>Poor quality of desktop apps</strong> - Known issues in core applications
  such as Nautilus don&#8217;t get fixed for years. Such things naturally
  piss me off. Trying to contribute to the solution of a problem is
  often met with apathy by maintainers. Btw Linux users think that
  Mozilla Firefox is very slow and memory hungry - but it turns out
  that the Windows version is generally performing a lot better (not
  to mention - supporting hardware video acceleration).</p>

<p>I can keep listing things here forever. When I come to think about it
for the entire time I&#8217;ve been using Linux only one major problem got
resolved - USB devices support. I still remember the days when I had
to write auto mounting policies myself or to use <em>mount</em> manually all
the time. I won&#8217;t even mention the quality of most proprietary apps on
Linux, the huge amount of missing essential application and the
unavailability of mainstream video games.</p>

<p>So this is it! Hasta la vista, Linux! You still remain the best server
operating system, though. You&#8217;ll always have a special place in my
heart and a VMWare instance on my Windows boxes.</p>

<h2>What I&#8217;ll miss</h2>

<ul>
<li>shell</li>
<li>transparency, control</li>
<li>package management</li>
<li>lack of viruses, malware</li>
</ul>


<p>Although most common desktop users probably don&#8217;t use the shell very
often, I practically live(d) in it. OS X has zsh and bash, so it&#8217;s a
long term option for me, but due to the need for new hardware I&#8217;ll be
using Windows 7 on the desktop front for now. Hopefully the rumors
that PowerShell is great will turned out to be true.</p>

<p>The ability to tweak every aspect of the configuration, to build
custom drivers and kernels will be missed as well, but I don&#8217;t tend to
do this as often as I used to. And when something bad happens - most
of the time you could do something about it. As a friend of mine used
to say &#8220;The single biggest difference between Windows and Linux is
that in Windows the restart will solve just about any problem, but in
Linux it&#8217;s unlikely so solve any problem&#8221; (this statement was much
more correct 8 years ago - modern Linux desktop distro have developed
some of Windows&#8217;s old habits).</p>

<p>Probably the biggest loss for me would be the wonderful distro package
management systems like YUM and APT.</p>

<p>During the time I used Linux I totally forgot that things like viruses
and malware existed. Now, after I installed Win 7 I was immediately
encouraged to install an anti-virus program.</p>

<h2>Based on your feedback</h2>

<p>It seems a lot of people misunderstood the purpose of my rant so I&#8217;d
like to clarify something for them:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I <strong>fuckin&#8217;</strong> love Linux. Linux is brilliant. Linux is fun. Linux
rekindled my interest in computing at a time when I was about to
give up on computing.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#8217;m not spreading FUD, I&#8217;m telling you a real story, a story that I
know many have experienced and many will experience.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#8217;m trying to raise the awareness of Linux desktop users. They&#8217;ve
been told that they have to be thankful for any kind of hardware
support, no matter how basic, fucked up and all around shitty it
might be. They&#8217;ve been told that they have to be grateful for every
crappy app in existence. The fact that something is free (as in
beer), doesn&#8217;t make it wrong for people to criticize it and complain
about it. Ranting is what drives evolution. Same thing happens in
life every day - the media and the people around us proclaim
mediocrecy, they tell us that mediocrecy is OK, that we should be
satisfied by what we have and that aspiring for greatness is a
foolhardy mission. The Linux desktop community should put real
pressure on hardware and software vendors to be taken seriously,
instead of just waiting on their mercy. The Linux desktop community
deserves a great Linux desktop.</p></li>
<li><p>Fanatics are dangerous. They cannot see past their beliefs, they
cannot be reasoned with. The Linux community is full of them -
zealots that never see any problems with Linux and feel that the
entire world is on a quest to discredit their (mine) beloved
OS. They won&#8217;t ever get this post, but hopefully YOU will.</p></li>
<li><p>Hardware support is a big part of the Linux desktop problem, but
it&#8217;s not the only problem. Half-baked DE like KDE 4.0, Ubuntu&#8217;s
Unity and GNOME 3.0 are just as dangerous.</p></li>
<li><p>Having some hardware support and having great hardware support are
two different things.</p></li>
<li><p>I do know how to research hardware compatibility ( :-) surprising,
eh?), but I do like
cutting edge technologies as well (problematic&#8230;). Does it seems
normal to you to avoid commodity hardware just on the ground that
it&#8217;s &#8220;too new&#8221; to be properly employed by your OS of choice?</p></li>
<li><p>I&#8217;m not claiming that Windows 7 is the greatest thing after hot
water, I don&#8217;t even say that I like it. I do, however, say that it
offers superior desktop experience (when it works, that is).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;ll include here a great comment from Jan de Vos:</p>

<p>_While I&#8217;m still using Linux (usually Ubuntu, sometimes Fedora)
everywhere (at work and at home), I do agree with a lot of points in
this article; there are a lot of things that could be improved, and
there are a lot of frustrations that Windows users don&#8217;t have. Saying so
is not FUD, it is a simple truth. If someone who clearly likes a lot of
things in Linux decides to switch to something else, that really is a
bad thing, and an indication that there are real problems.</p>

<p>In my opinion, ignoring these problems, or even denying they exist, may
be a lot more harmful than talking about them._</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more!</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>I remember the first time I used Linux. A friend of mine installed
Fedora 2 on my personal computer and there was a glitch in GRUB that
prevented me from booting to Windows. My ethernet card wasn&#8217;t
supported so I was left without Internet. I asked my friend can I at
least watch a few movies, while he brought me a patched version of the
buggy GRUB. He told me - you need to compile MPlayer from sources with
several optimization, you need windows video codecs, etc. At the time this
excited me a lot - adventure, excitement. I learned A LOT by using
Linux non-stop for so long time. But at some point you stop learning
exciting things and are just stuck with tedious things you have to
keep doing over and over again. And as I already mentioned - I don&#8217;t
want my time wasted, I want to get the job done with minimum hassle.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been hearing each and every year that &#8220;year 20xx&#8221; will be the
year of the Linux desktop. It never came and it&#8217;s my firm believe that
it never will (unless something radically changes in the mindset of
Linux desktop users). Constantly plagued by hardware and software woes Linux
is doomed to fail. Without major support from hardware and software
vendors every OS is ultimately doomed to fail.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s no secret that a lot of money are made by Linux server businesses
and this naturally drives a lot of the development in the area of
improving server performance. Nobody put it better than
<a href="http://apcmag.com/why_i_quit_kernel_developer_con_kolivas.htm">Con Colivas</a>
- &#8221;<em>Linux is burdened with enterprise crap that makes it run poorly on
  desktop PCs.</em>&#8221;. Linux will remain the king of the
  server world, but on the desktop front it will always be an OS for
  enthusiast and hackers only.</p>

<p>Goodbye, my dear old friend. You&#8217;ll be missed&#8230; but not that much.</p>

<p>P.S. Btw I&#8217;m as pro a Linux user as they get - a professional sys
admin, a former kernel developer so don&#8217;t bother me with moronic
comments from the type &#8220;you&#8217;re not doing something right/you should
try another distro&#8221;.</p>

    <article class="post">
	<h1 class="title"><a href="/articles/2011/06/05/emacs-default-font/">Emacs Tip #1: Set the Default Font in Emacs 23</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Emacs 23.2 will pick up the default GNOME monospaced font, so if
you&#8217;re a GNOME user - you&#8217;re basically covered. If you&#8217;re not - don&#8217;t
worry.</p>

<p>The simplest way to set the Emacs font is just to add the following
in your .emacs (or init.el):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">set-default-font</span> <span class="s">&quot;Inconsolata-12&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This code will set the Emacs font to Inconsolata (my favorite
monospaced font) with font size 12pt. The problem with this approach
is that it will not work with a X Emacs client (emacsclient -c)
connecting to an Emacs daemon (emacs &#8211;daemon), because the code will
get run when the server starts and will basically mean nothing to
it. You can alleviate this problem by using the appropriate hook for X
clients, but I find this distasteful. A much simpler solution is to
forget about <em>set-default-font</em> altogether and simply create a file
named <strong>.Xdefaults</strong> in your home folder. Put the following in it:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>Emacs.font: Inconsolata-12
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Afterwards run the following command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At this point you can start Emacs (in normal or daemon mode) and
your new font settings should be in effect.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve been a GNU/Linux user for quite some time now and a Fedora user
for just as long. The first distribution that I ever used was Fedora 2
and even though I&#8217;ve used extensively other distros I&#8217;ve always come
back to Fedora. Recently Fedora 15 was released and I was
(naturally) one of the first people to install it.</p>

<p>Everything is great in the new release (as ever), but my Xerox Phaser
3117 printer is unsupported (also as ever) out of the box, so it&#8217;s
time for one of those quick articles on how to get it up and running this
time. First run the following command as root (or with sudo):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># yum install gutenprint-foomatic</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you can run the &#8220;Printing&#8221; application. It will autodetect your
printer and suggest you to use the driver for Xerox Phaser 3110. Just
accept this suggestion and you should be good to go. Happy printing!</p>

		<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve recently upgraded all my systems to Fedora 15. The default
installation is not very usable for some tasks for several reasons -
like CD size limitations and software patents for instance. I also
happen to disagree with some defaults in Fedora like the fact that
sudo is not enabled by default (like in Ubuntu) and the use of the
bash shell. In this article I&#8217;ll share some of the things I do after a
fresh Fedora 15 installation to enhance it (at least by my standards).</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>So far in the Java.next() series I&#8217;ve discussed only languages that
were engineered from the start to run on the JVM (<a href="/Java/Groovy/2011/05/06/jvm-langs-groovy.html">Groovy</a>, <a href="/Java/Scala/2011/05/08/jvm-langs-scala.html">Scala</a> and
<a href="/Clojure/Java/2011/05/12/jvm-langs-clojure.html">Clojure</a>). However, a lot of good programming languages existed even
before the inception of the idea to run languages other than Java on top of
the JVM. Some notable examples are Ruby and Python for instance. Today
I&#8217;ll be writing about <a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a> - the pure Java port of the Ruby
programming language (and undoubtedly the most advanced and widely
adopted of the 9 (!) actively maintained Ruby ports).</p>

<p>This post will differ somewhat from the others so far, because I won&#8217;t
be spending any time to dwell on the basic Ruby syntax and will only
highlight the advantages over plain old Ruby that JRuby provides -
like calling Java code from a Ruby application and scripting Ruby from a
Java application.</p>

<h2>Why JRuby?</h2>

<p>Ruby has long been known as one of the most elegant programming
languages out there. With the rise of the Rails web framework several
years ago the language was propelled into the mainstream and showed a
lot of common developers alternative (better) ways to get their jobs done with
less hassle and more grace. While the language is generally well liked
(albeit is has some syntax quirks and oddities, mostly courtesy of its
Perl heritage) its default execution environment MRI (Matz&#8217;s Ruby
Interpreter) is not the object of international affection. As an
application written in C it suffers some portability problems (a few
years ago it was quite hard to get MRI to run properly on Windows and
even now you might run into some missing dll error from time to
time). MRI&#8217;s performance is not stellar either and it even used to be
quite terrible before the advent of Ruby 1.9 which incorporated YARV
(Yet Another Ruby VM), which significantly improved its performance
(but still left a what to be desired). There is also the problem with
the missing standard portable GUI development library and the somewhat
limited deployment options because of MRI&#8217;s limited
portability.</p>

<p>Matz&#8217;s has often said that he&#8217;s no VM specialist, he&#8217;s a
language architect/designer and the beauty of the language concerns
him more than the performance of the reference implementation. He&#8217;s
also said that he loves diversity and is certain that interested
parties will offer high quality alternatives to the standard Ruby
runtime.</p>

<p>When it comes down to a high quality runtimes few people don&#8217;t start
thinking immediately about the Java platform, known for its infinite
(not literally infinite of course, but vast enough) libraries,
rock-solid and secure JVM and great support for compile-time and
runtime performance
optimizations. It&#8217;s not unheard for a Java application to match and
excel the performance of a native C application by employing
techniques like <em>just in time</em>(JIT) compilation, hot spot detection and
optimizations, etc.</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s only natural that at some point a bunch of people decided to
create a version of Ruby that could run on top of the acclaimed
JVM. This version of Ruby is (believe it or not) known as JRuby. With
JRuby you get the best of both Java and the Ruby worlds. Here are just a few possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deploy a Ruby on Rails web application to Google’s App Engine
service.</li>
<li>Write a Rails web frontend to your existing Java enterprise
application.</li>
<li>Target the latest Android smartphones with your Ruby code using <a href="http://ruboto.org/">Ruboto</a></li>
<li>Create cross-platform GUIs with Java&#8217;s Swing (or SWT)</li>
<li>Build your project on solid libraries written in Java, Scala, Clojure,
or other JVM languages.</li>
<li>Use the solid platform independent JDBC database
drivers. Platform dependent drivers used with MRI Ruby are a common
source of gripe for developers trying to migrate an application from
one platform to another.</li>
</ul>


<p>Great prospects indeed! Now it&#8217;s about time to get that magical piece
of software called JRuby up and running&#8230;</p>

<h2>Installing JRuby</h2>

<p>There are several options to consider in the department of JRuby
installation. JRuby requires a Java runtime 5.0+ to be installed. You
can get one from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Using an Installer</h4>

<p>The easiest way to install JRuby is to use one of the prebuilt installers
available from the <a href="http://jruby.org/download">official download site</a>. These will take care of the
low level of detail, such as setting up your <strong>PATH</strong> environment
variable to make finding JRuby easier.
The JRuby team currently maintains installers for Windows and Mac
machines. If you&#8217;re on Linux, your distribution may package its own
JRuby build. For example, on Ubuntu (or any other Debian derived
distro) you can type this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install jruby
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Red Had distribution users might try this incantation instead:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo yum install jruby
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Most Linux distributions don&#8217;t upgrade to the latest JRuby release the
instant it comes out. If you want to stay with the latest and greatest,
you might prefer installing from an archive instead or RVM instead.</p>

<h4>Using RVM</h4>

<p>Most Ruby hackers
favour a powerful bash script called RVM(Ruby Version Manager) that
allows you to install several different version(or flavours of Ruby)
and switch easily between them. Please refer to the official
<a href="https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">RVM documentation</a> for installation
and usage instructions. After you&#8217;ve installed RVM getting JRuby
installed is a child&#8217;s play:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>rvm list known | grep jruby
</span><span class='line'>jruby-1.2.0
</span><span class='line'>jruby-1.3.1
</span><span class='line'>jruby-1.4.0
</span><span class='line'>jruby-1.6.0
</span><span class='line'>jruby<span class="o">[</span>-1.6.1<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>jruby-head
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>rvm install jruby
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>rvm use jruby
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Just for the record - I personally use RVM and I recommend to all
*BSD, Linux &amp; OS X hackers to try it out as well - great piece of
software. One of the nicer side effects of using RVM is that you won&#8217;t
have to run operations like <strong>gem install</strong> as the root user.</p>

<h4>Using prebuilt archive</h4>

<p>If you have a heavily customized setup or just like doing things
yourself, you can get a .zip or .tar.gz archive from the same download
page. Extract the archive somewhere convenient on your system, such
as <strong>C:** or </strong>/opt**. You can run JRuby straight from its own <em>bin</em>
folder, but you&#8217;ll probably find it more convenient to add it to
your PATH. On UNIX (including Linux &amp; Mac OS X), you can do the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$PATH</span>:/opt/jruby/bin
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Testing the installation</h4>

<p>Type the following commands:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>which jruby

</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>jruby -e <span class="s1">&#39;puts &quot;Hello, JRuby!&quot;&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>Hello, JRuby!
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we can see some of the unique JRuby features in action.</p>

<h2>Common tasks with JRuby</h2>

<p><strong>REPL</strong></p>

<p>JRuby comes with an equivalent of the standard Ruby REPL irb, called
jirb. To start it simply type:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>jirb
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you can do some interactive Ruby development:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>jirb is a great tool for exploratory programming and has some nice
features like TAB completion. Use it often!</p>

<h4>Running scripts</h4>

<p>Same as before (with MRI Ruby):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>jruby some_script.rb
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That was simple, right?</p>

<h4>Running Ruby tools</h4>

<p>You should prefix calls to common Ruby tools like gem and rake with
<strong>jruby -S</strong> - otherwise they might get confused which Ruby version
(if you have more than one Ruby installed, that is) to use:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>jruby -S gem install rails
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>jruby -S rake install
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Using the JRuby compiler</h4>

<p>You can compile Ruby scripts directly to Java bytecode and run the
resulting class files using the JVM:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>jrubyc hello.rb
</span><span class='line'>Compiling hello.rb to class example
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The compiler supplies a main method for you, so you can now run the
program straight from the java command (adjust the path here to point
to your JRuby installation):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>java -cp .:/opt/jruby/lib/hello.jar example
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that your compiled program still depends on some JRuby-defined
support routines, so jruby.jar needs to be on your classpath. Also,
the compiler compiles only the files you specifically pass to it. If
you reference some_ruby_library.rb from hello.rb, you&#8217;ll have to
compile that extra .rb file yourself or ship it in source form
alongside your .class file. The Java compiler understands dependencies
between source files and compiles them automatically so Java
developers should keep this difference in mind.</p>

<h2>Using Java from JRuby</h2>

<p>One of the nicest features of JRuby is undoubtedly the ability to use
Java libraries directly in your Ruby code. JRuby goes a long way to
make the Java classes integrate into normal Ruby code as seamlessly as
possible - for instance it gives you the ability to call methods using the
snake_naming_convention, instead of the common in Java
camelCaseNamingConvention. Let&#8217;s see the Java integration in action:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>You shouldn&#8217;t, of course, use ArrayList unless you&#8217;re using a Java API
that is requiring you to do so. Hopefully these simple examples gave
you an idea how easy it is to access Java code from JRuby.</p>

<p>It might be tempting to think of Java/Ruby integration as nothing more
than calling from one language to another. That&#8217;s not the case. In a
typical project, you&#8217;re really interacting with both platforms.  You
might construct a Ruby object, pass it to a Java function, and watch
the Java code call other Ruby methods you&#8217;ve defined. All the advanced
interactions are beyond the scope of this cursory overview, but you&#8217;re
definitely encouraged to explore them on your own.</p>

<h2>Using JRuby from Java</h2>

<p>While Java libraries are capable of doing just about anything they are
generally not as elegant as some of their Ruby counterparts. This might
make you want to run some Ruby code from a Java program. JRuby allows
you do this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This example is quite basic, but you should be able to grasp the basic
idea from it.</p>

<h2>Compatibility with standard Ruby and performance</h2>

<p>JRuby 1.6 is mostly compatible with MRI Ruby 1.9.2. Since Ruby doesn&#8217;t
have a formal standard and is mostly defined in terms of the reference
implementation (although there are some compatibility test suites)
alternative implementations like JRuby are bound to be a step behind
the current reference version from time to time. JRuby, however,
catches up very quickly and has reached a state in popularity and adoption
at which I&#8217;m certain that they (the JRuby team) keep an open communication channel with
upstream MRI developers and are capable to add the new features with
very little delay.</p>

<p>In terms of performance JRuby is slightly faster in many tests than
MRI 1.9.2 and with the inclusion of support for dynamic method
dispatching in Java 7 (coming up later this year) the performance will
probably be improved significantly. The only real performance problem
is the JVM startup time. If you&#8217;re using JRuby to run very simple
scripts you might be mislead to believe that JRuby&#8217;s very slow, when actually the
delay you&#8217;re witnessing is caused by the JVM startup (which is not
very fast). Some Ruby features like ObjectSpace don&#8217;t perform very
well on the JVM as well, but they are used rarely.</p>

<p>In a sentence - JRuby is quite compatible with the standard MRI Ruby
and one of the fastest Ruby implementations around.</p>

<h2>Deployment options and future prospects</h2>

<p>With JRuby your number of deployment options vastly improves - now you
can deploy your Ruby applications anywhere where a JVM can be run (and
there are lot such places, believe me about that). With JRuby you can
deploy your Rails applications on the Google App Engine or in a Java
enterprise container such as Glassfish. You can also write mobile
applications for the Android operating system.</p>

<p>JRuby&#8217;s development is funded by a very solid company, called
<a href="http://www.engineyard.com/">&#8220;Engine Yard&#8221;</a> which is famous for its world class Rails hosting
solutions. The company obviously has a lot at stake here and you
shouldn&#8217;t be afraid that JRuby might die anytime soon.</p>

<p>IT consulting companies like
<a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> have used JRuby to deliver both products and customer
applications on far more aggressive schedules than they could
have with more conventional languages</p>

<h2>The tools of the trade</h2>

<p>Most Ruby hackers tend to program without the aid of sophisticated
IDEs. Emacs, vim and TextMate are popular choices. Recently
<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">SublimeText</a> has been getting a fair share of attention as well. While
it&#8217;s fairly easy to write Ruby code in a text editor it&#8217;s generally a
nightmare to write Java code in an editor. Some of the most old-school
hardcore developers that I know bowed down before the complexity of
Java and started using Eclipse, NetBeans or IntelliJ to keep their
sanity intact. When you&#8217;re working on a project that&#8217;s a mixture of Ruby
and Java code it might be a good choice to opt for using some IDE as
well.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> - The legendary Java IDE comes with a very capable
Ruby plug-in, that integrates well with Rails, the common templating
languages often used with it and most Ruby testing
frameworks. IntelliJ even has a variant for pure Ruby development
called <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine</a> which is regarded by many devs as the best Ruby
IDE out there.</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/RubySupport">NetBeans</a> - At some point the core JRuby team were employed by
Sun and at that time great Ruby support was added to
NetBeans. Oracle killed the official Ruby support in NetBeans 7.0,
but it&#8217;s still maintained as a community project. It&#8217;s not as good
as the one in RubyMine, but it doesn&#8217;t cost anything either.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dltk/">Eclipse</a> - Eclipse has an official
Ruby plug-in(part of DLTK), but most people tend to prefer using
<a href="http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3">Aptana Studio</a> - a web
development IDE built on top of Eclipse.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>JRuby is a solid addition to the ranks of JVM languages. Given the
fact that Ruby served as the principle inspiration for Groovy many
people will probably do better to use JRuby in preference to Groovy
(except the ones fond of the Java syntax I guess). I personally love
both Ruby and the JVM and for me JRuby was a match made in heaven. It
opens a lot new and exciting possibilities before one of the most
beautiful languages ever conceived.</p>

<p>I particularly like the ability to create portable GUIs with Swing and
the extended deployment options that JRuby provides. If Java 7 brings
the promised speed improvements I&#8217;m certain that JRuby will have a
shot at becoming the reigning Ruby implementation.</p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? Go grab a copy of the JRuby Bible
<a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/jruby/using-jruby">&#8220;Using JRuby&#8221;</a> and
start coding. :-)</p>
