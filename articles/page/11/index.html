	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>Programming languages have always been a passion of mine and through
the years I&#8217;ve learnt quite a few of them. The first one was Pascal,
some 13 years ago, and the last was Scala, just a couple of months ago.</p>

<p>Although the authors of many languages claim that the language they
created is the greatest thing after hot water, this is rarely the
case. Most of the &#8220;unique&#8221; features are not quite unique, and the truly
unique stuff is often just useless. I don&#8217;t believe that there is a
single greatest and unparallelled language, but I do believe that some
languages are more valuable them others in term of both theory(the
concepts around which they revolve) and practice(the chances of you
landing a job with them or simply getting a task done).</p>

<p>In this blog post I&#8217;ll review the ten or so languages that I&#8217;ve found to
be most enlightening/helpful for me over the years. I think that every
professional software engineer should have at least a passing
knowledge of them.</p>

<h2>C</h2>

<p>The C programming language has been around for about forty
years now (it appeared in 1973). While it&#8217;s often viewed as a higher
level assembly language today in the era of Java, .Net and Python, C
remains the sole choice for doing serious system programming - writing
drivers, all kinds of servers and virtual machines.</p>

<p>Learning C also give you an insight to the inner working of the
computer, like memory management and native data types (based on a CPU&#8217;s
registries).</p>

<p>The best way to get started with C
hasn&#8217;t changed in the past 20+ years - just pick a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628">&#8220;The C
Programming Language&#8221;</a> by K&amp;R.</p>

<h2>Lisp</h2>

<blockquote><p>Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment<br/>experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will<br/>make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you<br/>never actually use Lisp itself a lot.</p><footer><strong>Eric S. Raymond</strong> <cite>How to Become a Hacker</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>One of the oldest programming languages around - created in 1958 and
still relevant today. Important for its unique code is data approach,
advanced code generation facilities (macros) and the ability to develop
software in incremental and interactive fashion.</p>

<p>Although many of the features that originally made it truly
unique (like garbage collection, if expression, function objects) are
now found in many modern languages, Lisp still offers some compelling
alternatives for those interested to explore it.</p>

<p>These days Common Lisp is considered the canonical Lisp dialect - a
multi-paradigm language with excellent support for imperative,
functional and object-oriented programming. Another popular dialect is
Scheme which is a simpler language focused mainly on functional
programming and until recently was a popular choice for teaching
introductory programming classes in many major US
universities (recently it&#8217;s being displaced by Python).</p>

<p>You cannot start with a better introduction to Common Lisp than Peter
Seibel&#8217;s
<a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">&#8220;Practical Common Lisp&#8221;</a>. If you
fancy Scheme more take a look at the classic text
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">&#8220;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&#8221;</a>. A
good source of exercises for aspiring Lisp programmers are the
<a href="/Misc/Common%20Lisp/2011/05/04/lisp-problems.html">&#8220;Lisp Problems&#8221;</a>(a work in progress based on the original &#8220;Prolog Problems&#8221;).</p>

<h2>Java</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s face it - if you&#8217;re in the market for jobs a third of them are
about Java EE or Android development (the other two thirds are probably
related to PHP and .NET). The language is not quite
elegant, but the platform is truly magnificent. Although there are
many other languages targeting the JVM (Scala, Groovy, Clojure, JRuby,
Jython - just to name a few) Java is still predominant by a wide
margin and this is unlikely to change soon. It&#8217;s actually <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">the most
popular programming language in the world</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve taught a couple of introductory Java programming courses (in
Bulgarian), but I&#8217;d recommend the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Core-Java-TM-I--Fundamentals-8th/dp/0132354764/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303901341&amp;sr=1-1">&#8220;Core Java&#8221;</a>
book over my lectures any day of
the week. :-)</p>

<h2>Haskell</h2>

<p>Functional programming has been gaining popularity in recent years
with the rise of parallel computers, and of the pure functional
programming languages Haskell is probably the closest to the
mainstream. It features great ideas like type inference, lazy
evaluation, monads, pattern matching. As with Lisp many of the
features of Haskell can be found in more impure packages(like Scala
and Clojure), but Haskell is still the top pure functional language in
my humble opinion.</p>

<p>There are great free Haskell learning resources
on-line like <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">&#8220;Learn you a Haskell for great good&#8221;</a> and <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/">&#8220;Real world
Haskell&#8221;</a></p>

<h2>Perl</h2>

<p>Once the undisputed king of the Internet Perl has recently fallen down
from grace in its battle with the newer generation of dynamic
languages like PHP, Ruby and Python. While I wouldn&#8217;t advise anyone to
start writing Web or Enterprise apps with Perl it&#8217;s still the best language for
writing administration and helper scripts with minimum fuss and maximum
developer throughput. It features the greatest support for text
processing ever and an extremely flexible (albeit a bit of confusing)
syntax.</p>

<p>Perl <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> is probably the largest collection of third party
libraries for a single language ever assembled.</p>

<p>Pick up a copy of <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596520113">&#8220;Learning Perl&#8221;</a> or just browse the excellent
<em>perldoc</em> and start coding in Perl right away.</p>

<h2>Clojure</h2>

<p>Clojure is a Lisp dialect with an unique support for parallel and
concurrent programming and runs on top of the venerable JVM. If you&#8217;re
looking to do some serious parallel programming look no further. Other
than that you&#8217;ll find in Clojure a superb collection of functional
data structures, pervasive use of laziness, higher order functions and
tail-call optimizations,
and some rather novel ideas on the topics of state and
identity. Clojure also cleans up a bit the traditional Lisp
syntax (read this as Clojure has fewer parentheses than say Common Lisp).</p>

<p>To get started I recommend you to watch the free Clojure screencasts
on <a href="http://clojure.blip.tv/">blip.tv</a>.</p>

<h2>Prolog</h2>

<p>The most famous language from the logic programming family. Solving a
problem like a sudoku puzzle in Prolog will be an eye opening
experience for any developer. While it&#8217;s unlikely that you&#8217;ll ever use
it practice the ideas found in it, Prolog will truly expand your thinking
horizons.</p>

<p>A good starting point in your journey to Prolog will be
<a href="http://www.learnprolognow.org/">&#8220;Learn Prolog Now&#8221;</a>. You may do a
follow up with the collection of programming puzzles <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems/">&#8220;Prolog problems&#8221;</a>.</p>

<h2>Ruby</h2>

<p>A pure object oriented dynamic scripting language with a very nice support for
metaprogramming. It has versions written in Java (JRuby) and
.Net (IronRuby) which makes it easy to integrate it with any software
for those popular platforms. The language became popular with the rise of the Ruby
on Rails web framework, but it has many potential applications that don&#8217;t
involve RoR or web development.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Ruby-1-9-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356085/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303901367&amp;sr=1-1">&#8220;Programming Ruby&#8221;</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Programming-Language-David-Flanagan/dp/0596516177/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303901367&amp;sr=1-3">&#8220;The Ruby Programming Language&#8221;</a> are two of the
best introductory Ruby books around.</p>

<h2>Python</h2>

<p>A pure object oriented dynamic scripting language with a focus on
simplicity, readability and maintainability. Popular for development
of web applications, GUI applications and system administration
utilities. Driven by the motto &#8220;There is only one way to do it&#8221; and
the philosophy &#8220;It comes with battery included&#8221;. Python is Google&#8217;s
darling and is widely used by the IT giant.</p>

<p>A nice free on-line book about Python is <a href="http://diveintopython3.org/">&#8220;Dive into Python 3&#8221;</a>.</p>

<h2>C</h2>

<p>The flagman language of the .NET platform. Similar in many aspects to
Java C# is never-the-less ahead then Java in the innovations
department - first to introduce concepts like Generics and Attributes
to the mainstream programmers. It features some nice improvements over
Java like properties, flexible namespaces and limited type inference.</p>

<p>The primary reason it&#8217;s included in this list, however, is simply
the sheer amount of job openings for C## developers. In my home
country (Bulgaria) about a third of all programming positions are C##
related.</p>

<p>My favourite C# book happens to be
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/C-Depth-Second-Jon-Skeet/dp/1935182471/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1304516334&amp;sr=8-3">&#8220;C# in Depth&#8221;</a>. You
might happen to enjoy it as well.</p>

<h2>Scala</h2>

<p>An interesting blend of pure object orientation and functional
programming with some concurrency support baked in (actors). Of the
current crop of JVM languages, next to Clojure, Scala looks most
promising. It features an advanced static type system (more advanced
than Haskell&#8217;s), state of the art Java integration, support for
pattern matching, extractors and other functional goodness. If any
language has a chance of displacing the Java programming language it
must be Scala&#8230; Even the father of Java James Gosling acknowledged
that if he decided to replace Java with another language it would be Scala.</p>

<p>Start your journey to Scala mastery with
<a href="http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/">&#8220;Programming in Scala&#8221;</a>.</p>

<h2>JavaScript</h2>

<p>We cannot conclude this whirlwind tour of notable programming
languages without mentioning the King of the Web, the language that
drove the Web 2.0 revolution - JavaScript. Although it has a terrible
name (JavaScript shares nothing with Java), a questionable programming
model built around mutating global variables, and prototype instead of
class inheritance, it is supported virtually everywhere (most web
browsers have built-in JavaScript interpreters) and any web
developer will do well to learn some JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>We cannot be experts in ten or twenty programming languages - I&#8217;m
certain of that. I do,
however, believe that all the ideas and techniques that we discover in
different programming languages will generally enrich our thinking and
make us better software engineers in principle.</p>

<p><em>P.S. If you&#8217;re wondering why a certain &#8220;great&#8221; language X is not on
the list keep in mind that this is my personal(and highly subjective)
point of view on the subject. Who knows, in some dark and twisted
place there may very well be people who consider BASIC a programming
language masterpiece&#8230; :-)</em></p>

    <article class="post">
	<h1 class="title"><a href="/articles/2011/04/26/thoughts-on-the-kindle/">Thoughts on the Amazon Kindle</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>I love reading - I love fiction, I love technical literature, I love
newspapers and magazines. I&#8217;m also a bit of old fashioned - I love the
feel and smell of paper, I love the ability to feel the pages. So it
took me quite some time to convince myself to buy one of the fabled
Amazon Kindle e-book reading devices. People often ask me what I think
about it and would I recommend them to buy one so I decided to write
down my thoughts here.</p>

<h2>The things I love about the Kindle</h2>

<h3>Typography</h3>

<p>The typography of the fiction books on the Kindle is simply amazing -
the fonts and the typesetting are close to perfect. The only thing
that is a bit off is the justification of some lines but this happens
very rarely. Most of the paper books I&#8217;ve recently bought have so
terrible typography that they simply appal me.</p>

<h3>Quality of images</h3>

<p>This one really surprised me - the images and photos look very good on
the Kindle(unless they are very big and have to be scaled down).</p>

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p>The navigation is outstanding - I think the idea to double the buttons
for forward/backward page was a brilliant one. The ability to skip
chapters and to easily navigate the table of contents is fairly handy
as well. Unfortunately not all mobi books are created with an useful
table of contents, but this is not a problem of the Kindle itself.</p>

<h3>Built-in dictionary</h3>

<p>Although my knowledge of English is considered quite considerable I&#8217;m
no native speaker and when I read fancy books from time to time I
encounter words I do not know. Having the built-in dictionary I can
just move the cursor to the word in question and I see its meaning
inline. This is so very cool!</p>

<h3>Weight &amp; size</h3>

<p>The Kindle is smaller and lighter than most paperbacks. And you can
carry literary hundreds of books on your kindle.</p>

<h3>Battery life</h3>

<p>Without the wireless the battery lasts for about a month&#8230;</p>

<h3>Amazon Kindle store</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s so easy to find and buy the books you want. You have the option
to buy something from the website and it will be automatically sent to
your Kindle or you can find and buy books from the Kindle itself if
you&#8217;re connected to the Internet.</p>

<h3>Free 3G</h3>

<p>The Amazon Kindle store is always at hand.</p>

<h3>The official lighted leather cover</h3>

<p>The
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kindle-Lighted-Leather-Display-Generation/dp/B003DZ165W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303826907&amp;sr=8-1">cover</a>
is made of leather and makes the Kindle appearance quite similar to
that of a real book. It also features LED light powered by the Kindle
itself with which you can easily read even in the darkest
places. Unfortunately it&#8217;s very expensive - it costs half as much as
the Kindle&#8230;</p>

<h3>E-ink screen</h3>

<p>Looks like a real book, immune to sunlight, great contrast.</p>

<h3>Collections</h3>

<p>You can organise your books into collections on various criteria.</p>

<h3>Ebooks are generally cheaper</h3>

<p>This is not true for all books(at least not yet). At least you save
the shipping expenses(if you have any).</p>

<h3>Highlights and sharing</h3>

<p>You can see passages other people highlighted as interesting and add
highlights and notes yourself. You can also tweet passages and stuff
like that. The Kindle is social&#8230;</p>

<h2>The things I don&#8217;t like</h2>

<h3>PDF support</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s so horrible I can barely describe it. Basically PDF are
unreadable and everyone that tell you otherwise is lying to you. The
Kindle DX is large enough to accommodate PDF I guess, but not the
normal Kindle.</p>

<h3>Formatting is terrible in technical books</h3>

<p>If you read a lot of books with diagrams, tables, source code, etc the
Kindle is not for you(or at least not for that task). Everything is
scrambled and confusing. Basically this and the previous item made me
buy an iPad 2 for reading PDFs and technical books.</p>

<h3>The web browser is mostly useless</h3>

<p>The Kindle has an experimental web browser, which is mostly useless
mainly due to the inherent limitation of the e-ink screen(such a
enormous refresh rate).</p>

<h3>Real page numbers</h3>

<p>The ability to cross reference paper pages with ebook pages was added
in a recent firmware update, but I haven&#8217;t seen any books that have
those page markers.</p>

<h3>Keyboard</h3>

<p>Mostly useless, probably a future version with some touchscreen
display would drop it. It just takes up valuable place.</p>

<h3>Screen is not touch sensitive</h3>

<p>In the first day I owned the devices I often tried to turn pages by
swiping the screen. I&#8217;m quite fond of touch screen interfaces and one
of those can make the Kindle even smaller.</p>

<h3>Magazines and newspapers are crippled</h3>

<p>Because the publishers have to pay some fee to amazon based on the
traffic they generate with their magazines/newspapers the Kindle
version are generally stripped down from a lot of images and other
content.</p>

<h3>No easy way to lend/borrow books</h3>

<p>Currently we have services like lendle.me, but they have a very
limited library. Soon the Kindle will have built-in lending support
and this will improve the situation immensely.</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>Basically the Kindle is the greatest thing after hot water for people
that read a lot of fiction books. Everyone else should consider buying
a tablet.</p>

    <article class="post">
	<h1 class="title"><a href="/articles/2011/04/26/jrebel-with-scala/">Incremental Development With Scala and JRebel</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of the things I love most about Lisp development is the ability to
develop applications in an incremental interactive manner - you write
one function, compile it, load into your current REPL session, make
some adjustments and repeat this process until you get satisfactory
results. You never stop to compile your project, you never have to
restart your application server. Without those distractions it&#8217;s
easier to maintain your concentration and to remain in the <em>flow</em>.</p>

<p>With languages like Scala and Java, however, you cannot do this - at
least without a bit of external help. This help comes in the form of an
application called <a href="http://www.zeroturnaround.com/jrebel/">JRebel</a>, which basically reloads the classes in your
program as you make changes to them and recompile them. JRebel is a commercial
application and generally you have to pay to use it&#8230; unless you want
to you use it for Scala development, that is. ZeroTurnaround(the
company that makes JRebel) offers
<a href="http://sales.zeroturnaround.com/wp-content/themes/zeroturnaround4.0/modals/applyForLicense.php">free licences to Scala developers</a>
and if you&#8217;re one of them you should definitely get one.</p>

<p>Installing JRebel is trivial - generally you have to only extract a
zip file(or use an installer) somewhere and drop in the JRebel folder
the licence file that they have e-mail you. Afterwards you simply have
to integrate JRebel with your build system. JRebel can also be
integrated with IDEs, but I want cover this here. I use mostly
<a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven 3</a> and
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/">SBT</a> so I&#8217;ll show you
what to do for them. With Maven you have to add the following to the
<em>$MAVEN_OPTS</em> environmental variable:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">MAVEN_OPTS</span><span class="o">=</span>-noverify -javaagent:/home/bozhidar/work/jrebel/jrebel.jar
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Since most people use JRebel for web development to avoid the need to
restart their application containers and Scala&#8217;s most prominent
framework is <a href="http://liftweb.net">Lift</a> you&#8217;d probably want to enable
the JRebel Lift plug-in as well:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">MAVEN_OPTS</span><span class="o">=</span>-noverify -javaagent:/home/bozhidar/work/jrebel/jrebel.jar
</span><span class='line'> -Drebel.lift_plugin<span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">true</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Stick this in your shell&#8217;s init file and source it to make it
available in the shell.</p>

<p>Now when you start your web app with</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>mvn jetty:run
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And the continuous Scala compilation with</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>mvn scala:cc
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The compiler with pickup the changes you made and JRebel will reload
the changed classes behind the scenes. The development process this
way starts to feel a bit like using a scripting language such as Ruby
or PHP.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using SBT you should modify the sbt startup script to
include the same options that I mentioned in the section about Maven
configuration. Mine sbt script looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
</span><span class='line'>

<p>Another use for JRebel is the Scala REPL itself. When you start the
REPL from inside SBT for instance with the command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sbt console
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>changes to the imported classes will be reflected automatically
without the need to do a <em>:replay</em> or restart the REPL - something
reminiscent of the interactive Lisp programming I mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? Go grab JRebel and speed up your Scala
development process.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/articles/2011/04/24/emacs-dev-kit/">Emacs Dev Kit</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>During the past few months I&#8217;ve been working on a project to convert
my vast Emacs configuration into something generally useful and
self-contained that could help the general software engineer. Thus the
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-dev-kit">Emacs Dev Kit</a> was
born. Conceptually it&#8217;s similar to the older
<a href="https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit">Emacs Starter Kit</a>
and it even shares a bit of code with it. The Emacs Dev Kit, however,
target more programming languages and features more
customizations/enhancements.</p>

<p>EDT relies on ELPA for packages that are available there and packages
everything else locally. At some point I&#8217;ve played with the idea of
using el-get instead, but I had a lot of problems with it and thought
that using only ELPA would be better since it would be part of
Emacs 24. Everything is tested only on the latest version of GNU
Emacs(currently 23.2). I&#8217;ve tried to do everything in the most
efficient and modern way - for instance SLIME is supposed to be
installed via Quicklisp so it could be easily updated without waiting
for a new version of the EDK.</p>

<p>EDK currently offers enhanced(well, I know that this is subjective,
but it feels enhanced at least to me) support for the following
languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>C/C++</li>
<li>Clojure</li>
<li>Common Lisp</li>
<li>Emacs Lisp</li>
<li>Haskell</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>LaTeX</li>
<li>Perl</li>
<li>Prolog</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Scala</li>
<li>Scheme</li>
<li>XML</li>
</ul>


<p>It also offers an advanced ERC configuration(so that you can ask your
questions on #freenode), extended keybindings and lots of general
purpose utility functions.</p>

<p>EDT goes a step further and even includes a different color-theme by
default - zenburn. You can turn it off easily of course, but I have
the feeling that many programmers will appreciate its eye strain
reducing qualities.</p>

<p>The project is still very young and mostly untested. I&#8217;d be thankful
for feedback, bug reports and suggestions.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/articles/2011/04/24/add-atom-feed-to-jekyll/">Add Atom Feed to Jekyll Powered Blog</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As you know I&#8217;ve recently migrated my blog from WordPress to
Jekyll. One of the things I had to do was add an Atom feed(RSS
sucks). It was quite the easy task. I just had to create an
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/blog/blob/master/atom.xml">atom.xml</a> file
and place in the root of my blog.</p>

<p>Afterwards I only had to link my default layout to the atom feed:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;alternate&quot;</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;application/atom+xml&quot;</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;atom.xml&quot;</span> <span class="na">title=</span><span class="s">&quot;Atom feed&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At this point I was able to subscribe to my new atom feed(and
hopefully my followers(which I may or may not have) were able to do
the same).</p>
