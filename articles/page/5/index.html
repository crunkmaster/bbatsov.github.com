		<p>It&#8217;s been quite a while since my last blog post. And there hasn&#8217;t been that
much action on the open-source projects I happen to maintain
either. The reason for this is quite simple - recently I&#8217;ve joined the
ranks of the social trading start-up <a href="http://tradeo.com">Tradeo</a> and
things have been crazy at work ever since.</p>

<p>While this is without a doubt my coolest job to date, it&#8217;s also the
most demanding. Anyways - just wanted to let you know I&#8217;m doing OK and
I plan to resume my usual blogging and open-source coding duties soon.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>This is a guest post from my friend <a href="http://about.me/atodorov">Alexander Todorov</a>
who is a QA guru, software engineer and cloud enthusiast!</em></p>

<p><strong>Software changes fast! Open source software even faster!</strong></p>

<p>And once you start to update dependencies, libraries and frameworks it never ends&#8230;
After all the testing and validation you may have done there is no
guarantee that the software will keep working afterwards.
This is no big deal for small and medium sized projects but becomes a full-time
job for larger projects with longer life span which require constant maintenance
and enhancements. I&#8217;ve seen this time and time again during my work on various projects.
Even a simple <em>Drupal</em> based website pops up an update every couple of weeks.</p>

<p>OTOH back porting fixes and keeping stable APIs can be a big business. This is what
<em>Red Hat</em> is doing for their <em>Red Hat Enterprise Linux</em> distribution. Nearly all changes
are backwards compatible and and the software stack remains stable compared
to upstream <em>Fedora</em> or the more upstream projects which comprise it.</p>

<p>Let me say that I don&#8217;t like to upgrade. Long ago I was using <em>Debian</em> <strong>stable</strong>
on my computer. Now I use <em>RHEL</em>. No fancy features, no bells and
whistles and more important predictable behavior wrt updates and APIs.
The same approach I take when developing software. I stay away from the latest and
greatest technology simply because it changes too often. I prefer mature frameworks and
packages which produce new versions every six months or less frequent.
This approach allows me to concentrate on writing code and getting the project done
instead of plumbing bugs introduced by the latest <em>package foo</em> version.</p>

<p>All this said I have a very careful approach to upgrades, especially if I&#8217;m
using an upstream package. I will first look at the changelog if any. Luckily
many of the mature projects provide comprehensive changelog records. This is
especially true for Perl packages. I&#8217;m looking for notices about backward
incompatible changes, API breakage, security notices, major bug fixes,
changes in behavior and the like.
When changelog is not available there&#8217;s the commit log. I admit this is
not something I usually look at but it happens once in a while. I do this for projects
I&#8217;m particularly interested in or otherwise following.
Doing a content diff is another possibility which usually helps you
spot (if you look carefully) some API changes as well. I resort to this if I&#8217;m not able to find the upstream
source repository or when it is hosted on something ancient like CVS.</p>

<p>Based on all of this I decide to upgrade or not. With careful planning
of updates (which version, which moment of time) and testing I manage to
minimize the hassle of breaking my projects and spending days fixing
bugs afterwards. Instead I use the time to write some code that kicks ass
(or at least I hope so).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m curious to know what sort of information folks do prefer to have
when considering an update? Changelog vs. API diff or seething else?
I personally prefer well written Changelog and full list of fixed bugs.
Please cast your vote in the comments or visit the

    <article class="post">
	<h1 class="title"><a href="/articles/2012/04/06/melpa-homebrew-emacs-edition/">MELPA - Homebrew (Emacs Edition)</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A few weeks ago I wrote an
<a href="http://batsov.com/articles/2012/02/19/package-management-in-emacs-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/">article about the state of package management in Emacs</a>. In
that article I pointed out that on the side of <a href="http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Package.el">package.el</a> too much
was riding on the poorly maintained Marmalade repo. Today
Marmalade went dark (again) and many people are wondering what to do
now. The answer is simple - start using <a href="http://melpa.milkbox.net/">MELPA</a> instead.</p>

<p>I was thinking of starting a project similar to Marmalade to alleviate
its problems, but then the MELPA project was brought to my
attention. This project follows the Homebrew (unofficial OSX package
manager) model of using simple GitHub collaboration to maintain and
grow a bunch of build recipes. In the case of MELPA, those recipes
show how to bundle upstream source packages into package.el-compliant
packages. The recipes can be tested locally by package authors, and
they are run hourly on the MELPA server to create an HTTP package
archive that Emacs users can simply add to their <code>'package-archives</code>
list. As <a href="http://technomancy.us">Phil Hagelberg</a> said - there&#8217;s no reason to drag in
complicated dependencies like Node for something that&#8217;s essentially a
pile of static files. MELPA on the other hand is written mostly in
Emacs Lisp and is thus much more comprehensible to casual Emacs hackers.</p>

<p>Most packages currently contained in MELPA are development snapshots,
but the project maintainer
<a href="https://github.com/milkypostman">Donald Curtis</a> and
<a href="http://www.sanityinc.com/">Steve Purcell</a> (aka <code>sanityinc</code>) are
working on extending the MELPA build scripts to support stable
packages, using upstream version tags.</p>

<p>Adding a new package to MELPA is as simple as adding a few lines of
code to the <code>pkglist</code> file in MELPA&#8217;s source code repo:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">name</span> <span class="ss">:url</span> <span class="s">&quot;&lt;repo url&gt;&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="ss">:fetcher</span> <span class="nv">[git|svn|darcs</span><span class="err">|</span><span class="nv">wiki]</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="nv">[:files</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;&lt;file1&gt;&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">]</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You simply have to fork the <a href="https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa">official repo</a>, modify <code>pkglist</code>, send a pull
request and <code>package.el</code> compatible packages will be built
automatically for you on MELPA&#8217;s server (you can also build the
packages locally to test if everything is OK with your recipes). Sure it&#8217;s not as easy as
submitting a package via a web UI, but it&#8217;s a much more robust
approach. It also eliminates a common problem in Marmalade - there
only the original uploader (+ people selected by him) can update a
package. Often the original uploaders are very hard to find&#8230;</p>

<p>To use MELPA with Emacs 24 (or a recent version of <code>package.el</code>) just
add this to your <code>.emacs</code> (or equivalent):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-to-list</span> <span class="ss">&#39;package-archives</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;melpa&quot;</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="s">&quot;http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="no">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There&#8217;s a lot more info regarding MELPA on its official website and
I&#8217;d rather not duplicate it here.</p>

<p>I would encourage package authors and users to investigate and
contribute to MELPA. I&#8217;ve already submitted a bunch of packages
there and rebased <a href="http://batsov.com/prelude">Emacs Prelude</a> to
use MELPA instead of Marmalade.</p>

<p>Together we can turn MELPA into the most extensive and robust community-supported
<code>package.el</code> repo! Emacs users deserve one of those :-)</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/articles/2012/03/26/wikemacs-the-other-emacs-wiki/">WikEmacs - the Other Emacs Wiki</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;d like to apologize to everyone insulted by my previous
posts. Contrary to popular belief I acknowledge EmacsWiki&#8217;s
contribution to the Emacs community. Obviously many people are too
fond of its current format so I doubt that it will ever change
(considerably). I didn&#8217;t mean to insult anyone, I just wanted to catch
your attention (which unfortunately requires harsher words from time to
time) and point it in the direction of the existing problems.</p>

<p>For the people that weren&#8217;t happy with EmacsWiki - the ones that felt
my pain and were looking for a change I present
<a href="http://wikemacs.org">WikEmacs</a> (pronounced wikimacs). It&#8217;s a
MediaWiki powered Emacs wiki, that will try to bring to the community
cleaner, leaner and more up-to-date documentation.</p>

<p>There are only a few guidelines for the contributors there:</p>

<ul>
<li>articles should be geared only towards the current and future
versions of Emacs (currently 23 and 24) for maintainability&#8217;s sake.</li>
<li>articles should not copy Emacs&#8217;s or extension&#8217;s official
documentation - they should refer to it instead. An overview, some
nice pointers, tips and links - that seems like a good article,
doesn&#8217;t it?</li>
<li>comments and questions should go to an article&#8217;s discussion page</li>
</ul>


<p>File uploads are disabled on WikEmacs (but image file uploads will
probably be allowed soon) - it will never host Emacs extensions of any
sort.</p>

<p>There is a Google discussion group
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/wikemacs">here</a>
for more general questions regarding the wiki.</p>

<p>Our goal is not to copy over the 8500 articles available at
EmacsWiki. It&#8217;s to provide a good road map for new users coming to
Emacs and enough helpful hints and tips for experienced users. Everyone
is welcome to join our efforts.</p>

<p>As far as short term goals go - have a look at the outlined structure
of the wiki (on its home page), pick a section that interests you and
create/extend/improve it. Our content is licensed with GNU&#8217;s Free
Documentation License (which is compatible with Wikipedia&#8217;s and
probably EmacsWiki&#8217;s GPL2). Some nice blog articles about Emacs might
be converted to wiki articles with permission from their authors. You
might find <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/try">pandoc</a> useful to
automatically convert articles from other formats to MediaWiki markup
and <a href="https://launchpad.net/mediawiki-el">mediawiki.el</a> to edit
articles on wiki from the comfort of your beloved editor.</p>

<p>Thanks to the people that brought us the original EmacsWiki. Thanks to
everyone who supported the idea for the new wiki. Thanks in advance to
all future contributors.</p>

<p>Some people will undoubtedly see the birth of WikEmacs as a separatist move to fraction
the Emacs community. To them I&#8217;d like to say that few things in life
are as productive as competition. Obviously a lot of people willing to
contribute to a new wiki are unwilling to do so for EmacsWiki and vice
versa. This is not a contest and there will be no winner. I wish the
best of luck to EmacsWiki and its supporters. What I wish for is to give
our community the best source of documentation available and the
option to choose.</p>
