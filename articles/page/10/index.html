	<h1 class="title"><a href="/articles/2011/06/05/emacs-default-font/">Emacs Tip #1: Set the Default Font in Emacs 23</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Emacs 23.2 will pick up the default GNOME monospaced font, so if
you&#8217;re a GNOME user - you&#8217;re basically covered. If you&#8217;re not - don&#8217;t
worry.</p>

<p>The simplest way to set the Emacs font is just to add the following
in your .emacs (or init.el):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">set-default-font</span> <span class="s">&quot;Inconsolata-12&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This code will set the Emacs font to Inconsolata (my favorite
monospaced font) with font size 12pt. The problem with this approach
is that it will not work with a X Emacs client (emacsclient -c)
connecting to an Emacs daemon (emacs &#8211;daemon), because the code will
get run when the server starts and will basically mean nothing to
it. You can alleviate this problem by using the appropriate hook for X
clients, but I find this distasteful. A much simpler solution is to
forget about <em>set-default-font</em> altogether and simply create a file
named <strong>.Xdefaults</strong> in your home folder. Put the following in it:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>Emacs.font: Inconsolata-12
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Afterwards run the following command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At this point you can start Emacs (in normal or daemon mode) and
your new font settings should be in effect.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve been a GNU/Linux user for quite some time now and a Fedora user
for just as long. The first distribution that I ever used was Fedora 2
and even though I&#8217;ve used extensively other distros I&#8217;ve always come
back to Fedora. Recently Fedora 15 was released and I was
(naturally) one of the first people to install it.</p>

<p>Everything is great in the new release (as ever), but my Xerox Phaser
3117 printer is unsupported (also as ever) out of the box, so it&#8217;s
time for one of those quick articles on how to get it up and running this
time. First run the following command as root (or with sudo):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># yum install gutenprint-foomatic</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you can run the &#8220;Printing&#8221; application. It will autodetect your
printer and suggest you to use the driver for Xerox Phaser 3110. Just
accept this suggestion and you should be good to go. Happy printing!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve recently upgraded all my systems to Fedora 15. The default
installation is not very usable for some tasks for several reasons -
like CD size limitations and software patents for instance. I also
happen to disagree with some defaults in Fedora like the fact that
sudo is not enabled by default (like in Ubuntu) and the use of the
bash shell. In this article I&#8217;ll share some of the things I do after a
fresh Fedora 15 installation to enhance it (at least by my standards).</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/articles/2011/05/18/jvm-langs-jruby/">Java.next() - JRuby: The Rubyists Strike Back</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>So far in the Java.next() series I&#8217;ve discussed only languages that
were engineered from the start to run on the JVM (<a href="/Java/Groovy/2011/05/06/jvm-langs-groovy.html">Groovy</a>, <a href="/Java/Scala/2011/05/08/jvm-langs-scala.html">Scala</a> and
<a href="/Clojure/Java/2011/05/12/jvm-langs-clojure.html">Clojure</a>). However, a lot of good programming languages existed even
before the inception of the idea to run languages other than Java on top of
the JVM. Some notable examples are Ruby and Python for instance. Today
I&#8217;ll be writing about <a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a> - the pure Java port of the Ruby
programming language (and undoubtedly the most advanced and widely
adopted of the 9 (!) actively maintained Ruby ports).</p>

<p>This post will differ somewhat from the others so far, because I won&#8217;t
be spending any time to dwell on the basic Ruby syntax and will only
highlight the advantages over plain old Ruby that JRuby provides -
like calling Java code from a Ruby application and scripting Ruby from a
Java application.</p>

<h2>Why JRuby?</h2>

<p>Ruby has long been known as one of the most elegant programming
languages out there. With the rise of the Rails web framework several
years ago the language was propelled into the mainstream and showed a
lot of common developers alternative (better) ways to get their jobs done with
less hassle and more grace. While the language is generally well liked
(albeit is has some syntax quirks and oddities, mostly courtesy of its
Perl heritage) its default execution environment MRI (Matz&#8217;s Ruby
Interpreter) is not the object of international affection. As an
application written in C it suffers some portability problems (a few
years ago it was quite hard to get MRI to run properly on Windows and
even now you might run into some missing dll error from time to
time). MRI&#8217;s performance is not stellar either and it even used to be
quite terrible before the advent of Ruby 1.9 which incorporated YARV
(Yet Another Ruby VM), which significantly improved its performance
(but still left a what to be desired). There is also the problem with
the missing standard portable GUI development library and the somewhat
limited deployment options because of MRI&#8217;s limited
portability.</p>

<p>Matz&#8217;s has often said that he&#8217;s no VM specialist, he&#8217;s a
language architect/designer and the beauty of the language concerns
him more than the performance of the reference implementation. He&#8217;s
also said that he loves diversity and is certain that interested
parties will offer high quality alternatives to the standard Ruby
runtime.</p>

<p>When it comes down to a high quality runtimes few people don&#8217;t start
thinking immediately about the Java platform, known for its infinite
(not literally infinite of course, but vast enough) libraries,
rock-solid and secure JVM and great support for compile-time and
runtime performance
optimizations. It&#8217;s not unheard for a Java application to match and
excel the performance of a native C application by employing
techniques like <em>just in time</em>(JIT) compilation, hot spot detection and
optimizations, etc.</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s only natural that at some point a bunch of people decided to
create a version of Ruby that could run on top of the acclaimed
JVM. This version of Ruby is (believe it or not) known as JRuby. With
JRuby you get the best of both Java and the Ruby worlds. Here are just a few possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deploy a Ruby on Rails web application to Google’s App Engine
service.</li>
<li>Write a Rails web frontend to your existing Java enterprise
application.</li>
<li>Target the latest Android smartphones with your Ruby code using <a href="http://ruboto.org/">Ruboto</a></li>
<li>Create cross-platform GUIs with Java&#8217;s Swing (or SWT)</li>
<li>Build your project on solid libraries written in Java, Scala, Clojure,
or other JVM languages.</li>
<li>Use the solid platform independent JDBC database
drivers. Platform dependent drivers used with MRI Ruby are a common
source of gripe for developers trying to migrate an application from
one platform to another.</li>
</ul>


<p>Great prospects indeed! Now it&#8217;s about time to get that magical piece
of software called JRuby up and running&#8230;</p>

<h2>Installing JRuby</h2>

<p>There are several options to consider in the department of JRuby
installation. JRuby requires a Java runtime 5.0+ to be installed. You
can get one from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Using an Installer</h4>

<p>The easiest way to install JRuby is to use one of the prebuilt installers
available from the <a href="http://jruby.org/download">official download site</a>. These will take care of the
low level of detail, such as setting up your <strong>PATH</strong> environment
variable to make finding JRuby easier.
The JRuby team currently maintains installers for Windows and Mac
machines. If you&#8217;re on Linux, your distribution may package its own
JRuby build. For example, on Ubuntu (or any other Debian derived
distro) you can type this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install jruby
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Red Had distribution users might try this incantation instead:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo yum install jruby
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Most Linux distributions don&#8217;t upgrade to the latest JRuby release the
instant it comes out. If you want to stay with the latest and greatest,
you might prefer installing from an archive instead or RVM instead.</p>

<h4>Using RVM</h4>

<p>Most Ruby hackers
favour a powerful bash script called RVM(Ruby Version Manager) that
allows you to install several different version(or flavours of Ruby)
and switch easily between them. Please refer to the official
<a href="https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">RVM documentation</a> for installation
and usage instructions. After you&#8217;ve installed RVM getting JRuby
installed is a child&#8217;s play:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>rvm list known | grep jruby
</span><span class='line'>jruby-1.2.0
</span><span class='line'>jruby-1.3.1
</span><span class='line'>jruby-1.4.0
</span><span class='line'>jruby-1.6.0
</span><span class='line'>jruby<span class="o">[</span>-1.6.1<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>jruby-head
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>rvm install jruby
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>rvm use jruby
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Just for the record - I personally use RVM and I recommend to all
*BSD, Linux &amp; OS X hackers to try it out as well - great piece of
software. One of the nicer side effects of using RVM is that you won&#8217;t
have to run operations like <strong>gem install</strong> as the root user.</p>

<h4>Using prebuilt archive</h4>

<p>If you have a heavily customized setup or just like doing things
yourself, you can get a .zip or .tar.gz archive from the same download
page. Extract the archive somewhere convenient on your system, such
as <strong>C:** or </strong>/opt**. You can run JRuby straight from its own <em>bin</em>
folder, but you&#8217;ll probably find it more convenient to add it to
your PATH. On UNIX (including Linux &amp; Mac OS X), you can do the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$PATH</span>:/opt/jruby/bin
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Testing the installation</h4>

<p>Type the following commands:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>which jruby
</span><span class='line'>~/.rvm/rubies/jruby-1.6.1/bin/jruby
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>jruby -version
</span><span class='line'>jruby 1.6.1 <span class="o">(</span>ruby-1.8.7-p330<span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span>2011-04-12 85838f6<span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span>Java HotSpot<span class="o">(</span>TM<span class="o">)</span> Server VM 1.6.0_22<span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">[</span>linux-i386-java<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>jruby -e <span class="s1">&#39;puts &quot;Hello, JRuby!&quot;&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>Hello, JRuby!
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we can see some of the unique JRuby features in action.</p>

<h2>Common tasks with JRuby</h2>

<p><strong>REPL</strong></p>

<p>JRuby comes with an equivalent of the standard Ruby REPL irb, called
jirb. To start it simply type:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>jirb
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you can do some interactive Ruby development:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="go">Hello, JRuby</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="go"> =&gt; nil</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="go">jruby-1.6.1 :002 &gt; arr = [&quot;Chuck&quot;, &quot;Sarah&quot;, &quot;Morgan&quot;, &quot;Casey&quot;]</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>jirb is a great tool for exploratory programming and has some nice
features like TAB completion. Use it often!</p>

<h4>Running scripts</h4>

<p>Same as before (with MRI Ruby):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>jruby some_script.rb
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That was simple, right?</p>

<h4>Running Ruby tools</h4>

<p>You should prefix calls to common Ruby tools like gem and rake with
<strong>jruby -S</strong> - otherwise they might get confused which Ruby version
(if you have more than one Ruby installed, that is) to use:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>jruby -S gem install rails
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>jruby -S rake install
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Using the JRuby compiler</h4>

<p>You can compile Ruby scripts directly to Java bytecode and run the
resulting class files using the JVM:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>jrubyc hello.rb
</span><span class='line'>Compiling hello.rb to class example
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The compiler supplies a main method for you, so you can now run the
program straight from the java command (adjust the path here to point
to your JRuby installation):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>java -cp .:/opt/jruby/lib/hello.jar example
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that your compiled program still depends on some JRuby-defined
support routines, so jruby.jar needs to be on your classpath. Also,
the compiler compiles only the files you specifically pass to it. If
you reference some_ruby_library.rb from hello.rb, you&#8217;ll have to
compile that extra .rb file yourself or ship it in source form
alongside your .class file. The Java compiler understands dependencies
between source files and compiles them automatically so Java
developers should keep this difference in mind.</p>

<h2>Using Java from JRuby</h2>

<p>One of the nicest features of JRuby is undoubtedly the ability to use
Java libraries directly in your Ruby code. JRuby goes a long way to
make the Java classes integrate into normal Ruby code as seamlessly as
possible - for instance it gives you the ability to call methods using the
snake_naming_convention, instead of the common in Java
camelCaseNamingConvention. Let&#8217;s see the Java integration in action:</p>

<p>You shouldn&#8217;t, of course, use ArrayList unless you&#8217;re using a Java API
that is requiring you to do so. Hopefully these simple examples gave
you an idea how easy it is to access Java code from JRuby.</p>

<p>It might be tempting to think of Java/Ruby integration as nothing more
than calling from one language to another. That&#8217;s not the case. In a
typical project, you&#8217;re really interacting with both platforms.  You
might construct a Ruby object, pass it to a Java function, and watch
the Java code call other Ruby methods you&#8217;ve defined. All the advanced
interactions are beyond the scope of this cursory overview, but you&#8217;re
definitely encouraged to explore them on your own.</p>

<h2>Using JRuby from Java</h2>

<p>While Java libraries are capable of doing just about anything they are
generally not as elegant as some of their Ruby counterparts. This might
make you want to run some Ruby code from a Java program. JRuby allows
you do this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This example is quite basic, but you should be able to grasp the basic
idea from it.</p>

<h2>Compatibility with standard Ruby and performance</h2>

<p>JRuby 1.6 is mostly compatible with MRI Ruby 1.9.2. Since Ruby doesn&#8217;t
have a formal standard and is mostly defined in terms of the reference
implementation (although there are some compatibility test suites)
alternative implementations like JRuby are bound to be a step behind
the current reference version from time to time. JRuby, however,
catches up very quickly and has reached a state in popularity and adoption
at which I&#8217;m certain that they (the JRuby team) keep an open communication channel with
upstream MRI developers and are capable to add the new features with
very little delay.</p>

<p>In terms of performance JRuby is slightly faster in many tests than
MRI 1.9.2 and with the inclusion of support for dynamic method
dispatching in Java 7 (coming up later this year) the performance will
probably be improved significantly. The only real performance problem
is the JVM startup time. If you&#8217;re using JRuby to run very simple
scripts you might be mislead to believe that JRuby&#8217;s very slow, when actually the
delay you&#8217;re witnessing is caused by the JVM startup (which is not
very fast). Some Ruby features like ObjectSpace don&#8217;t perform very
well on the JVM as well, but they are used rarely.</p>

<p>In a sentence - JRuby is quite compatible with the standard MRI Ruby
and one of the fastest Ruby implementations around.</p>

<h2>Deployment options and future prospects</h2>

<p>With JRuby your number of deployment options vastly improves - now you
can deploy your Ruby applications anywhere where a JVM can be run (and
there are lot such places, believe me about that). With JRuby you can
deploy your Rails applications on the Google App Engine or in a Java
enterprise container such as Glassfish. You can also write mobile
applications for the Android operating system.</p>

<p>JRuby&#8217;s development is funded by a very solid company, called
<a href="http://www.engineyard.com/">&#8220;Engine Yard&#8221;</a> which is famous for its world class Rails hosting
solutions. The company obviously has a lot at stake here and you
shouldn&#8217;t be afraid that JRuby might die anytime soon.</p>

<p>IT consulting companies like
<a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> have used JRuby to deliver both products and customer
applications on far more aggressive schedules than they could
have with more conventional languages</p>

<h2>The tools of the trade</h2>

<p>Most Ruby hackers tend to program without the aid of sophisticated
IDEs. Emacs, vim and TextMate are popular choices. Recently
<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">SublimeText</a> has been getting a fair share of attention as well. While
it&#8217;s fairly easy to write Ruby code in a text editor it&#8217;s generally a
nightmare to write Java code in an editor. Some of the most old-school
hardcore developers that I know bowed down before the complexity of
Java and started using Eclipse, NetBeans or IntelliJ to keep their
sanity intact. When you&#8217;re working on a project that&#8217;s a mixture of Ruby
and Java code it might be a good choice to opt for using some IDE as
well.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> - The legendary Java IDE comes with a very capable
Ruby plug-in, that integrates well with Rails, the common templating
languages often used with it and most Ruby testing
frameworks. IntelliJ even has a variant for pure Ruby development
called <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine</a> which is regarded by many devs as the best Ruby
IDE out there.</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/RubySupport">NetBeans</a> - At some point the core JRuby team were employed by
Sun and at that time great Ruby support was added to
NetBeans. Oracle killed the official Ruby support in NetBeans 7.0,
but it&#8217;s still maintained as a community project. It&#8217;s not as good
as the one in RubyMine, but it doesn&#8217;t cost anything either.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dltk/">Eclipse</a> - Eclipse has an official
Ruby plug-in(part of DLTK), but most people tend to prefer using
<a href="http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3">Aptana Studio</a> - a web
development IDE built on top of Eclipse.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>JRuby is a solid addition to the ranks of JVM languages. Given the
fact that Ruby served as the principle inspiration for Groovy many
people will probably do better to use JRuby in preference to Groovy
(except the ones fond of the Java syntax I guess). I personally love
both Ruby and the JVM and for me JRuby was a match made in heaven. It
opens a lot new and exciting possibilities before one of the most
beautiful languages ever conceived.</p>

<p>I particularly like the ability to create portable GUIs with Swing and
the extended deployment options that JRuby provides. If Java 7 brings
the promised speed improvements I&#8217;m certain that JRuby will have a
shot at becoming the reigning Ruby implementation.</p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? Go grab a copy of the JRuby Bible
<a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/jruby/using-jruby">&#8220;Using JRuby&#8221;</a> and
start coding. :-)</p>

    <article class="post">
	<h1 class="title"><a href="/articles/2011/05/17/recommended-ruby-books/">Recommended Ruby Books</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>Back in the day when Ruby wasn&#8217;t particularly popular outside Japan
there was only one book in English about Ruby -
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Ruby-1-9-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356085/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305641089&amp;sr=1-1">&#8220;Programming Ruby&#8221;</a>, affectionately called the Pickaxe by most
Rubyists. Those day are long gone now. Ruby on Rails propelled Ruby
into the mainstream and quite a few books on Ruby (and Rails) have
been published over the past five or so years. With so many books to
choose from developers often find it hard to pick up the <em>right</em> book.</p>

<p>In this post I&#8217;ll share with you my thoughts on the Ruby books that I&#8217;ve found
to be the most interesting and valuable. Feel free to disagree with
me, after all this is a highly subjective matter.</p>

<h2>Beginner books</h2>

<p>Every saga has a beginning, every journey has a first step, every
programming language has a first book&#8230;</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/ltp2/learn-to-program">Learn to Program</a></strong></p>

<p>A book that teaches programming to absolute beginners with Ruby as the
implementation language. I haven&#8217;t read this book (only excerpts from
it), but I&#8217;ve used it as a gift for several acquaintances of mine, with the
desire to learn to program. All of them were frustrated by other
introductory books they&#8217;ve read and all of them praised &#8220;Learn to
Program&#8221; for its immense clarity, engaging and enjoyable style and
comprehensible examples.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933988657/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_i7?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0Q48PY008200T745JZSF&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=470938631&amp;pf_rd_i=507846">The Well Grounded Rubyist</a></strong></p>

<p>&#8220;The Well Grounded Rubyist&#8221; is a thoroughly revised and updated edition
of the older book Ruby for Rails (which was 90% Ruby and 10% Rails). In this new book, author David
A. Black moves beyond Rails and presents a broader view of Ruby. It
covers Ruby 1.9 in great detail, unlike many introductory texts that
tend to offer only superficial coverage of many topics.</p>

<p>Starting with the basics, The Well-Grounded Rubyist explains Ruby
objects and their interactions from the ground up. In the middle
chapters, the book turns to an examination of Ruby&#8217;s built-in, core
classes, showing the reader how to manipulate strings, numbers,
arrays, ranges, hashes, sets, and more. Regular expressions get
attention, as do file and other I/O operations. At 500+ pages it&#8217;s a
bit of a hefty tome, but it&#8217;s definitely worth reading it.</p>

<h2>Reference books</h2>

<p>Reference books are not usually the biggest fun to read, but they tend
to cover everything a language has to offer and we generally keep them
close. Their value increases with the increase of our knowledge of a
particular language.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Programming-Language-David-Flanagan/dp/0596516177">The Ruby Programming Language</a></strong></p>

<p>Co-authored by Ruby&#8217;s creator Matz this is without a doubt the best
analysis of the languages. Everything you need to know is explained in
a crisp and easy to comprehend manner. The thing I liked most about the
book was the depth in which all the topics were discussed - given the
superficial coverage of some topics (such as encodings) in other books,
this book really stands out. The book is full of examples and
artwork by <em>why the lucky stiff</em>, and covers both Ruby 1.8 and 1.9. The
chapters on proc &amp; clojures and metaprogramming were particularly
strong. The books is geared mostly towards experienced programmers who
are new to Ruby. If you&#8217;re one of them - it&#8217;s unlikely you&#8217;ll find a
better starting point in your journey to Ruby mastery.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Ruby-1-9-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356085/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305636206&amp;sr=1-1">Programming Ruby</a></strong></p>

<p>Co-authored by the Pragmatic Programmers themselves (Dave Thomas &amp;
Andy Hunt) this was the very first English book on Ruby (and arguably
an instrument in Ruby&#8217;s international success). The first edition of
the books is freely available on-line, but it&#8217;s very outdated so I
wouldn&#8217;t recommend you to read it. The book has two parts
- a tutorial part and a reference part.</p>

<p>The tutorial part is very well written and quite readable. It&#8217;s geared
towards less experienced developers and you&#8217;ll not find as detailed
coverage of the topics as in &#8220;The Ruby Programming Language&#8221;. You&#8217;ll,
however, find full coverage of everything new in Ruby 1.9 - the book includes all the new and changed syntax and
semantics introduced since Ruby 1.8 and information about the new parameter
passing rules, local variable scoping in blocks, fibers,
multinationalization, and the new block declaration syntax.</p>

<p>The reference part of the book includes a description of all the
standard library modules, a complete reference for all built-in classes
and modules (including all the new and changed methods introduced by
Ruby 1.9).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure we need the whole Ruby standard library documentation on
paper anymore in the age of the Internet, but I guess some people will
find it helpful. I just feel that the additional documentation simply
made the book heavier (and possibly pricier).</p>

<h2>Intermediate Ruby books</h2>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve read a reference or a beginner&#8217;s Ruby book you might want
to move to some book that illustrates common Ruby style, techniques
and idioms.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Best-Practices-Gregory-Brown/dp/0596523009/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305640369&amp;sr=8-1">Ruby Best Practices</a></strong></p>

<p>&#8220;Ruby Best Practices&#8221; is aimed at programmers who want to use Ruby as
experienced Rubyists do. Written by the developer of the Ruby project
Prawn, this concise book explains how to design beautiful APIs and
domain-specific languages with Ruby, as well as how to work with
functional programming ideas and techniques that can simplify your
code and make you more productive. You&#8217;ll learn how to write code
that&#8217;s readable and expressive.</p>

<p>The whole book is currently available from free
<a href="http://blog.rubybestpractices.com/posts/gregory/022-rbp-now-open.html">on-line</a>
and has a very nice companion <a href="http://blog.rubybestpractices.com/">blog</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321584104/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305640620&amp;sr=1-1">Eloquent Ruby</a></strong></p>

<p>The latest (and one of the greatest) Ruby books I&#8217;ve read. The book
pretty much has the same aim as &#8220;Ruby Best Practices&#8221;, but covers a lot
more ground and is generally a lighter and more enjoyable read. Russ
Olsen has a very particular writing style that turns even the most
boring subjects into interesting discussions. All chapters feature
some real world examples of the concepts introduced, and a discussion
of potential pitfalls.</p>

<p>Very highly recommended second Ruby book.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Ruby-Russ-Olsen/dp/0321490452/ref=pd_sim_b_6">Design Patterns in Ruby</a></strong></p>

<p>A most enjoyable rendition of a generally boring subject by Russ Olsen. &#8220;Design
Patterns in Ruby&#8221; explores 14 of the classical GoF design patterns and
compares the canonical implementation of the patterns to idiomatic
Ruby versions of them. Every pattern features a discussion of common
use cases, pitfalls and real world usages.</p>

<p>The book also builds on top of the original patterns by adding a
couple of new ones like DSL and Convention over configuration.</p>

<p>Without a doubt one of the best Design pattern books and a must read
for all Ruby hackers. You don&#8217;t need any previous knowledge of design
patterns prior to reading this book, but there are a lot of references
to the classic GoF text so you might want to read it beforehand.</p>

<h2>Advanced Ruby books</h2>

<p>At some point you might want to explore some of the darker corners of Ruby.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Metaprogramming-Ruby-Program-Like-Pros/dp/1934356476/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305641577&amp;sr=1-1">Metaprogramming in Ruby</a></strong></p>

<p>The ability to modify programs at runtime is one the greatest
strengths of Ruby, but it seems to frighten a lot of people (which is
understandable given the constant usage of fancy words like
eigenclass). If you want to sharpen your Ruby metaprogramming skills -
this is the one true book.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Using-JRuby-Bringing-Ruby-Facets/dp/1934356654/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305641415&amp;sr=1-1">Using JRuby: Bringing Ruby to Java</a></strong></p>

<p>Believe it or not currently JRuby seems to be best Ruby implementation
around. If you&#8217;re interested in using JRuby you&#8217;d do well to learn
more about the integration with the JVM that JRuby provides as well as
the various new deployment options that JRuby introduces.</p>

<p>This book was written by the core JRuby developers and it&#8217;s absolutely
excellent. Clear and concise writing style, lots of useful examples.</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>There are certainly other great Ruby books around that I haven&#8217;t read,
but I guess that at some point reading books is just not as helpful as
writing real code. I do believe, however, that even experienced
developers can benefit from a good programming book.</p>

<p>So, which Ruby books that I&#8217;ve missed would you recommend?</p>
