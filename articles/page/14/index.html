	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>I love reading - I love fiction, I love technical literature, I love
newspapers and magazines. I&#8217;m also a bit of old fashioned - I love the
feel and smell of paper, I love the ability to feel the pages. So it
took me quite some time to convince myself to buy one of the fabled
Amazon Kindle e-book reading devices. People often ask me what I think
about it and would I recommend them to buy one so I decided to write
down my thoughts here.</p>

<h2>The things I love about the Kindle</h2>

<h3>Typography</h3>

<p>The typography of the fiction books on the Kindle is simply amazing -
the fonts and the typesetting are close to perfect. The only thing
that is a bit off is the justification of some lines but this happens
very rarely. Most of the paper books I&#8217;ve recently bought have so
terrible typography that they simply appal me.</p>

<h3>Quality of images</h3>

<p>This one really surprised me - the images and photos look very good on
the Kindle(unless they are very big and have to be scaled down).</p>

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p>The navigation is outstanding - I think the idea to double the buttons
for forward/backward page was a brilliant one. The ability to skip
chapters and to easily navigate the table of contents is fairly handy
as well. Unfortunately not all mobi books are created with an useful
table of contents, but this is not a problem of the Kindle itself.</p>

<h3>Built-in dictionary</h3>

<p>Although my knowledge of English is considered quite considerable I&#8217;m
no native speaker and when I read fancy books from time to time I
encounter words I do not know. Having the built-in dictionary I can
just move the cursor to the word in question and I see its meaning
inline. This is so very cool!</p>

<h3>Weight &amp; size</h3>

<p>The Kindle is smaller and lighter than most paperbacks. And you can
carry literary hundreds of books on your kindle.</p>

<h3>Battery life</h3>

<p>Without the wireless the battery lasts for about a month&#8230;</p>

<h3>Amazon Kindle store</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s so easy to find and buy the books you want. You have the option
to buy something from the website and it will be automatically sent to
your Kindle or you can find and buy books from the Kindle itself if
you&#8217;re connected to the Internet.</p>

<h3>Free 3G</h3>

<p>The Amazon Kindle store is always at hand.</p>

<h3>The official lighted leather cover</h3>

<p>The
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kindle-Lighted-Leather-Display-Generation/dp/B003DZ165W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303826907&amp;sr=8-1">cover</a>
is made of leather and makes the Kindle appearance quite similar to
that of a real book. It also features LED light powered by the Kindle
itself with which you can easily read even in the darkest
places. Unfortunately it&#8217;s very expensive - it costs half as much as
the Kindle&#8230;</p>

<h3>E-ink screen</h3>

<p>Looks like a real book, immune to sunlight, great contrast.</p>

<h3>Collections</h3>

<p>You can organise your books into collections on various criteria.</p>

<h3>Ebooks are generally cheaper</h3>

<p>This is not true for all books(at least not yet). At least you save
the shipping expenses(if you have any).</p>

<h3>Highlights and sharing</h3>

<p>You can see passages other people highlighted as interesting and add
highlights and notes yourself. You can also tweet passages and stuff
like that. The Kindle is social&#8230;</p>

<h2>The things I don&#8217;t like</h2>

<h3>PDF support</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s so horrible I can barely describe it. Basically PDF are
unreadable and everyone that tell you otherwise is lying to you. The
Kindle DX is large enough to accommodate PDF I guess, but not the
normal Kindle.</p>

<h3>Formatting is terrible in technical books</h3>

<p>If you read a lot of books with diagrams, tables, source code, etc the
Kindle is not for you(or at least not for that task). Everything is
scrambled and confusing. Basically this and the previous item made me
buy an iPad 2 for reading PDFs and technical books.</p>

<h3>The web browser is mostly useless</h3>

<p>The Kindle has an experimental web browser, which is mostly useless
mainly due to the inherent limitation of the e-ink screen(such a
enormous refresh rate).</p>

<h3>Real page numbers</h3>

<p>The ability to cross reference paper pages with ebook pages was added
in a recent firmware update, but I haven&#8217;t seen any books that have
those page markers.</p>

<h3>Keyboard</h3>

<p>Mostly useless, probably a future version with some touchscreen
display would drop it. It just takes up valuable place.</p>

<h3>Screen is not touch sensitive</h3>

<p>In the first day I owned the devices I often tried to turn pages by
swiping the screen. I&#8217;m quite fond of touch screen interfaces and one
of those can make the Kindle even smaller.</p>

<h3>Magazines and newspapers are crippled</h3>

<p>Because the publishers have to pay some fee to amazon based on the
traffic they generate with their magazines/newspapers the Kindle
version are generally stripped down from a lot of images and other
content.</p>

<h3>No easy way to lend/borrow books</h3>

<p>Currently we have services like lendle.me, but they have a very
limited library. Soon the Kindle will have built-in lending support
and this will improve the situation immensely.</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>Basically the Kindle is the greatest thing after hot water for people
that read a lot of fiction books. Everyone else should consider buying
a tablet.</p>

    <article class="post">
	<h1 class="title"><a href="/articles/2011/04/26/jrebel-with-scala/">Incremental Development With Scala and JRebel</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of the things I love most about Lisp development is the ability to
develop applications in an incremental interactive manner - you write
one function, compile it, load into your current REPL session, make
some adjustments and repeat this process until you get satisfactory
results. You never stop to compile your project, you never have to
restart your application server. Without those distractions it&#8217;s
easier to maintain your concentration and to remain in the <em>flow</em>.</p>

<p>With languages like Scala and Java, however, you cannot do this - at
least without a bit of external help. This help comes in the form of an
application called <a href="http://www.zeroturnaround.com/jrebel/">JRebel</a>, which basically reloads the classes in your
program as you make changes to them and recompile them. JRebel is a commercial
application and generally you have to pay to use it&#8230; unless you want
to you use it for Scala development, that is. ZeroTurnaround(the
company that makes JRebel) offers
<a href="http://sales.zeroturnaround.com/wp-content/themes/zeroturnaround4.0/modals/applyForLicense.php">free licences to Scala developers</a>
and if you&#8217;re one of them you should definitely get one.</p>

<p>Installing JRebel is trivial - generally you have to only extract a
zip file(or use an installer) somewhere and drop in the JRebel folder
the licence file that they have e-mail you. Afterwards you simply have
to integrate JRebel with your build system. JRebel can also be
integrated with IDEs, but I want cover this here. I use mostly
<a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven 3</a> and
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/">SBT</a> so I&#8217;ll show you
what to do for them. With Maven you have to add the following to the
<em>$MAVEN_OPTS</em> environmental variable:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">MAVEN_OPTS</span><span class="o">=</span>-noverify -javaagent:/home/bozhidar/work/jrebel/jrebel.jar
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Since most people use JRebel for web development to avoid the need to
restart their application containers and Scala&#8217;s most prominent
framework is <a href="http://liftweb.net">Lift</a> you&#8217;d probably want to enable
the JRebel Lift plug-in as well:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">MAVEN_OPTS</span><span class="o">=</span>-noverify -javaagent:/home/bozhidar/work/jrebel/jrebel.jar
</span><span class='line'> -Drebel.lift_plugin<span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">true</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Stick this in your shell&#8217;s init file and source it to make it
available in the shell.</p>

<p>Now when you start your web app with</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>mvn jetty:run
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And the continuous Scala compilation with</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>mvn scala:cc
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The compiler with pickup the changes you made and JRebel will reload
the changed classes behind the scenes. The development process this
way starts to feel a bit like using a scripting language such as Ruby
or PHP.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using SBT you should modify the sbt startup script to
include the same options that I mentioned in the section about Maven
configuration. Mine sbt script looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>java -noverify -javaagent:/home/bozhidar/work/jrebel/jrebel.jar
</span><span class='line'> -Drebel.lift_plugin<span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">true</span> -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled
</span><span class='line'> -XX:MaxPermSize<span class="o">=</span>512m -Xmx512M -Xss2M -jar <span class="sb">`</span>dirname <span class="nv">$0</span><span class="sb">`</span>/sbt-launch.jar
</span><span class='line'> <span class="s2">&quot;$@&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Another use for JRebel is the Scala REPL itself. When you start the
REPL from inside SBT for instance with the command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sbt console
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>changes to the imported classes will be reflected automatically
without the need to do a <em>:replay</em> or restart the REPL - something
reminiscent of the interactive Lisp programming I mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? Go grab JRebel and speed up your Scala
development process.</p>

    <article class="post">
	<h1 class="title"><a href="/articles/2011/04/24/emacs-dev-kit/">Emacs Dev Kit</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>During the past few months I&#8217;ve been working on a project to convert
my vast Emacs configuration into something generally useful and
self-contained that could help the general software engineer. Thus the
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-dev-kit">Emacs Dev Kit</a> was
born. Conceptually it&#8217;s similar to the older
<a href="https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit">Emacs Starter Kit</a>
and it even shares a bit of code with it. The Emacs Dev Kit, however,
target more programming languages and features more
customizations/enhancements.</p>

<p>EDT relies on ELPA for packages that are available there and packages
everything else locally. At some point I&#8217;ve played with the idea of
using el-get instead, but I had a lot of problems with it and thought
that using only ELPA would be better since it would be part of
Emacs 24. Everything is tested only on the latest version of GNU
Emacs(currently 23.2). I&#8217;ve tried to do everything in the most
efficient and modern way - for instance SLIME is supposed to be
installed via Quicklisp so it could be easily updated without waiting
for a new version of the EDK.</p>

<p>EDK currently offers enhanced(well, I know that this is subjective,
but it feels enhanced at least to me) support for the following
languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>C/C++</li>
<li>Clojure</li>
<li>Common Lisp</li>
<li>Emacs Lisp</li>
<li>Haskell</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>LaTeX</li>
<li>Perl</li>
<li>Prolog</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Scala</li>
<li>Scheme</li>
<li>XML</li>
</ul>


<p>It also offers an advanced ERC configuration(so that you can ask your
questions on #freenode), extended keybindings and lots of general
purpose utility functions.</p>

<p>EDT goes a step further and even includes a different color-theme by
default - zenburn. You can turn it off easily of course, but I have
the feeling that many programmers will appreciate its eye strain
reducing qualities.</p>

<p>The project is still very young and mostly untested. I&#8217;d be thankful
for feedback, bug reports and suggestions.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/articles/2011/04/24/add-atom-feed-to-jekyll/">Add Atom Feed to Jekyll Powered Blog</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As you know I&#8217;ve recently migrated my blog from WordPress to
Jekyll. One of the things I had to do was add an Atom feed(RSS
sucks). It was quite the easy task. I just had to create an
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/blog/blob/master/atom.xml">atom.xml</a> file
and place in the root of my blog.</p>

<p>Afterwards I only had to link my default layout to the atom feed:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;alternate&quot;</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;application/atom+xml&quot;</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;atom.xml&quot;</span> <span class="na">title=</span><span class="s">&quot;Atom feed&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At this point I was able to subscribe to my new atom feed(and
hopefully my followers(which I may or may not have) were able to do
the same).</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/articles/2011/04/23/moving-to-jekyll/">Moving From WordPress to Jekyll</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This is my first post after a very long hiatus partially induced by a
migration of my blog from WordPress to
<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, which I started half an
year ago and never quite finished(until today, that is).</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t particularly unhappy with WordPress, but some things there
irritated me - for instance it was hard to edit my posts within my
beloved Emacs(and yes - I know all the options and I hate them
all). Accidentally I&#8217;ve stumbled upon the post
<a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">&#8220;Bloggin like a hacker&#8221;</a>
and I instantly knew Jekyll was what I needed. It allows me to create
my posts as simple markdown templates, allows me to embed logic
written in Ruby in them and it has built-in support for code
highlighting(using the excellent Python library <em>pygments</em>). It also
allows me to store my blog under version control in github which is
really nice.</p>

<p>Jekyll is not particularly well documented and I had a few problems
with it at first, but I managed to overcome them all. One thing that
will be problematic for some users is the need to add things like rss,
commenting and analytics manually(they are bundled in a solution like
WordPress). On the other hand - you&#8217;re not tied to anything in
particular and may choose the service you like the most. I chose
<a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> for the comments and Google Analytics for the site
analytics(what a surprise).</p>

<p>By the way - my old blog Devcraft is no more. My new blog has a new
domain and a new theme(based on my favourite coding theme
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs">Zenburn</a>).  I know that the
blog is currently pig ugly and the content is not particularly great
either, but I&#8217;ll try to improve this along the way and add a lot of
interesting and hopefully useful information.</p>
