	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><strong>Updated 29/04/2011</strong></p>

<p>Lately, I’ve started digging more and more into Rails, preparing for
the start of a Rails powered project. Although there are some IDEs
offering decent Rails support(namely RubyMine, NetBeans, Komodo and
Aptana Studio) I have always preferred the comfort of Emacs for
various reasons. So naturally I embarked on a quest to setup a
suitable environment for Rails development in Emacs. After a couple of
days of searching and evaluating possible solutions I finally set up a
worthy environment. It consists of a couple of components –
<a href="http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/trunk/misc/ruby-mode.el?view=log">ruby-mode</a>,
<a href="http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/trunk/misc/inf-ruby.el?view=log">inf-ruby</a>,
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/autopair/">autopair-mode</a>,
<a href="http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/doc/nxhtml.html">nxhtml-mode</a>,
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/">yasnippet</a> and
<a href="http://rinari.rubyforge.org/">rinari</a>.</p>

<p>As you probably have guessed by now <em>ruby-mode</em> provides support for
editing ruby source files. The mode is pretty feature complete and
under active development, headed by none other than Matz(Ruby&#8217;s
creator) himself. I can only assume that Matz is an Emacs user
himself. You can get it from the ruby svn repository if you&#8217;re using a
version of Emacs older than Emacs 23(it&#8217;s built-in there).</p>

<p><em>inf-ruby</em> is a mode that spawns and inferior ruby process(irb shell)
to which you can directly send code from the ruby buffer you&#8217;re
currently editing. For instance - you can define a function and while
your cursor is inside it you can press C-M-x - the function definition
will be evaluated in irb automatically and you can test it there. This
is extremely handy!</p>

<p><em>autopair-mode</em> provides auto insertion of closing braces, quotes,
ends, etc. . Instructions how to setup both modes can be found
here. It&#8217;s a much more generic version of the <em>ruby-electric</em> mode
that used to do similar tasks, but just in Ruby buffers.</p>

<p>Although many people recommend adding pabbrev(a mode which
provides auto-completion) to the setup, I don’t recommend it – I find
the mode mostly annoying and stick to the old school dumb
auto-completion with M-/ . If you&#8217;re shopping for autocompletion,
however, a much better and smarter choice would be a
RSense[http://cx4a.org/software/rsense/].</p>

<p><em>yasnippet</em> is a package that offers dynamically expandable code
snippets(template), quite similar to ones in TextMate. It&#8217;s very easy
to add your very own snippets if you wish to.</p>

<p><em>nxhtml-mode</em> is a pretty comprehensive package for web development in
general. We need it for its excellent support for erb
templates(.rhtml, .erb.html) and of course xhtml and css. Lately it&#8217;s
not been as actively developed as it used to be, but it&#8217;s still a
pretty good mode. Alternatively you can use
<a href="https://github.com/nex3/haml">Haml</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/antonj/scss-mode">SASS</a> and forget about
nxhtml. Both have pretty decent Emacs modes available.</p>

<p><em>rinari</em> is a mode for Rails development – it contains rich
functionality such as the ability to easily navigate between models,
views and controllers in a Rails apfplication amongst other
features. Instructions how to set up rinari together with nxhtml-mode
can be found on rinari’s home page.</p>

<p>It’s always a good idea to add <a href="http://ecb.sourceforge.net/">ecb</a>(the Emacs code browser) to the mix,
though this is entirely optional.</p>

<p>A lot of the stuff I discussed here are part of the
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Emacs Prelude</a> that I
develop and maintain. I urge you to use the Emacs Prelude as a starting point to
develop your very own customized version of Emacs. Prelude comes with a
few ruby-mode customizations, yari(ri integration for Emacs), haml and
sass modes, autopair, yaml-mode, yasnippet, css-mode, ecb and a lot of
other goodies(projectile being one of my favourites).</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy this setup and it helps boost your Rails productivity in Emacs.</p>

    <article class="post">
	<h1 class="title"><a href="/articles/2008/06/16/das-keyboard/">Das Keyboard</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Every professional developer knows how important to the development
process the keyboard is, so it is only natural to be on the look for
some quality piece of hardware. After a long research in the area of
good keyboards I decided to upgrade my current rig to the recently
released <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/">Das Keyboard 3</a>.</p>

<p><img class="mechanical_keyboard.jpg" src="http://www.daskeyboard.com/images/products/mechanical_keyboard.jpg"></p>

<p>Das Keyboard comes in three flavours - Professional(mechanical
keyboard with labelled keys), Ultimate(the original mechanical
keyboard with blank keys) and Silent(mechanical keyboard with labelled
keys that doesn&#8217;t produce the trademarked clicking sound of the
original Das Keyboard).</p>

<p>I bought the Ultimate model, of course. I&#8217;ve been a touch typist for
several years now and I didn&#8217;t really cared about the labelled
keys(though I did miss them in games). Two words describe this
keyboard perfectly - <strong>Bad Ass</strong>. It&#8217;s without a doubt the single
finest piece of keyboard hardware that I&#8217;ve touched, it&#8217;s very
comfortable, very solid and I feel that I&#8217;ve actually improved my
typing speed with it. My colleagues don&#8217;t like the noisy work of the
keyboard very much, but I have no problems with it. I actually have
grown quite fond of it.</p>

<p>The keyboard also features a two port USB hub, that I didn&#8217;t really
consider when I was buying it, but it turned out quite helpful. I&#8217;ve
actually stopped using the USB ports of my computer entirely(except
for input devices) - I use the keyboard hub to plug-in flash drives
and charge devices. When your computer is sitting beneath a desk you
learn to appreciate USB hubs very quickly.</p>

<p>I have long heard stories about Das Keyboard&#8217;s quality
and comfort and I it has totally lived up to its hype. They price is
admittedly a bit steep(I bought two keyboards for home and for work
each costing 130$), but this is our hands and productivity we&#8217;re
talking about so we shouldn&#8217;t be cheap. So what are
waiting for - research the market yourselves and make your pick, your
hands deserve a quality keyboard(the Das Keyboard)!</p>

		<blockquote><p>Every Generation Has A Legend. Every Journey Has A First Step. Every<br/>Saga Has A Beginning.</p><footer><strong>Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</strong> <cite>Trailer</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Hello, everyone! Welcome to my blog!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll post here bits and pieces inspired by my humble experience as a
software developer. Expect to see primarily articles about Lisp,
Emacs, Java and Ruby, but also about software development in general.</p>

<p>As a fan of the Star Wars franchise I often like to quote characters
from the movies. I feel that this is the time for one such quote.</p>

<blockquote><p>Always two there are, no more, no less. A master and an<br/>apprentice.</p><footer><strong>Master Yoda</strong> <cite>The Phantom Menace</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>I’m no hacker wizard by any means, but I hope that I can
help someone learn something useful and maybe I&#8217;ll manage to learn something
from the readers of my blog(if I have any, that is). In this sense
one can say that in life we&#8217;re always the master and the apprentice at
the same time&#8230;</p>

<p>I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy reading my blog!</p>
