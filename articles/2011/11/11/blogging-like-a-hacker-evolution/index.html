<div class="entry-content"><h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve started my personal blog some three years ago. Back then in was
hosted on <a href="http://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> and was called
devcraft.wordpress.com. I had a lot of interesting (at least to me)
topics to write about on my mind, but I was immediately faced with a
serious problem - I felt very uncomfortable writing posts in a small
text area, using the primitive editing capabilities of a web
browser. Ordinary decent hackers love and value two tools above all
else - their text editor and their shell. And we love solving problems
automatically with clever programs and scripts, instead of manually.</p>

<p>I knew the only way to ever start writing, like I intended, to was to
actively involve them in the process. So here my story begins&#8230;</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>In Emacs We Trust</h2>

<p>My editor happens to be Emacs and I&#8217;ve started to look for ways to
blog without leaving its beloved frame. They were several options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use some browser extension that fires up Emacs when editing text
areas. For instance in Google Chrome there is the extension
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ljobjlafonikaiipfkggjbhkghgicgoh">Edit with Emacs</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-blog-wiki.html">org-mode</a> to write my posts.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://mwolson.org/projects/EmacsMuse.html">Emacs Muse</a> was another
option. Emacs Muse is an authoring and publishing environment for
Emacs. It simplifies the process of writings documents and
publishing them to various output formats. Muse uses a very simple
Wiki-like format as input. Muse consists of two main parts: an
enhanced text-mode for authoring documents and navigating within
Muse projects, and a set of publishing styles for generating
different kinds of output.</p></li>
<li><p>Use some Emacs mode, like
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WebloggerMode">weblogger-mode</a>, that
allows to write and publish WordPress (amongst others) entries directly from Emacs.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All these options had their merits, but they also had their
shortcomings. For one - there is only one writer&#8217;s markup that I
really enjoy and this is <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. This probably has something to do
with the fact that I&#8217;ve written quite a lot of stuff in GitHub and
Assembla using it. I also wanted the ability to easily include syntax
highlighted code snippets (since I generally write about programming)
and handy way to manage blog updates - preferably via git. I push
something to my repo and voila.</p>

<p>At the time I couldn&#8217;t make up my mind and my blog was left with a few
quite short posts, due to my inability to withstand being in wordpress
for any prolonged period of time.</p>

<p>Then something extraordinary happened in the beginning of this
year. I&#8217;ve stumbled upon the post
<a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">&#8220;Blogging Like a Hacker&#8221;</a>
by GitHub&#8217;s co-founder Tom Preston-Werner (aka mojombo). It seemed
that other people had exactly the same problem as me. It also seemed
they were more determined to do something about it.</p>

<h2>Along Comes Jekyll</h2>

<p>Long story short, Tom had written a blog aware static site generator,
called <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> in Ruby. Jekyll
posts are simply Markdown or Textile files and the
<a href="http://liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid templating language</a> is used to
enhance the posts in their post-processing phase. Code highlighting?
Jekyll (and pygments) has got your back. Nice, ah? There is
support for various layouts and here&#8217;s be best part - you could put
your blog in a GitHub repo and deploy automatically to GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>I instantly fell in love with Jekyll and as you can see from my
archive I&#8217;ve finally wrote some nice (arguably) &amp; long articles - like I&#8217;ve
originally intended.</p>

<p>While I was mostly happy with Jekyll there were a few things that
bothered me with it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You have to design your layouts yourself. While this is generally
fine if you have a sense for design, when you&#8217;re someone like me
that could yield some pretty ugly designs. I was so out of ideas
that I designed my Jekyll layout to look like my Emacs (down to the
Zenburn color theme) for which I got a lot of flak.</p></li>
<li><p>Maruku is a really crappy Markdown processor. I wished something
like RedCarpet was the default and that fenced code blocks (ala
GitHub) were the default option for code highlighting. Not that you
can&#8217;t replace Maruku with Kramdown or RedCarpet, but still. You&#8217;d
also have to patch Jekyll to run albino on the markdown files to get
the highlighting to work with the fenced blocks.</p></li>
<li><p>You have to do some really boring stuff like Disqus integration,
twitter integration, etc manually (or at least you have to manually
install some plugins).</p></li>
<li><p>You have to unroll your own deployment scripts, since Jekyll doesn&#8217;t
bundle any. Trivial task, but annoying non-the-less.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So there you have it - Jekyll is very nice, but it&#8217;s also very
barebone. My single biggest gripe with Jekyll, however, is that being
engineered by a GitHub guy it doesn&#8217;t support out of the box the
GitHub flavored Markdown. At some point as I was seriously
contemplating starting a new static site generator, similar to Jekyll,
that supported only RedCarpet as the Markdown processor and by
extension - the GitHub flavoured Markdown. It would have some nice
default theme and very reasonable default settings for use in a
blog. Google Analytics, Twitter, Disqus would be supported out of the
box. But I never got to writing it since just before I started I was
introduced to Octopress&#8230;</p>

<h2>Octopress is Jekyll with Batteries Included</h2>

<p>Emacs users are typically portrayed like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/articles/emacs_user.jpg"></p>

<p>I was naturally amused by the Octopress name.</p>

<p>First and foremost Octopress is Jekyll with batteries included. Some
of the nicer things include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A semantic HTML5 template</li>
<li>A Mobile friendly responsive (320 and up) layout (rotate, or resize your browser and see)</li>
<li>Built in 3rd party support for Twitter, Google Plus One, Disqus Comments, Pinboard, Delicious, and Google Analytics</li>
<li>An easy deployment strategy using Github pages or Rsync</li>
<li>Built in support for POW and Rack servers</li>
<li>Easy theming with Compass and Sass</li>
<li>A Beautiful Solarized syntax highlighting (though not as beautiful
as the Zenburn-one I&#8217;m about to release soon)</li>
</ul>


<p>And did I mention that there are a lot of nice plugins included?</p>

<p>The default theme is quite nice, but you&#8217;d probably want to tweak it a
bit (I still haven&#8217;t - but my sense of design is nonexistent). It&#8217;s
very easy to modify the theme.</p>

<p>I could go on and write a lot about Octopress, but there is no need to
do so. Go visit the official <a href="http://octopress.org">web site</a> - it has fantastic
documentation.</p>

<h2>Moving from Jekyll to Octopress</h2>

<p>Mostly trivial. I&#8217;ve just copied my old Markdown posts, adjusted the
headings and the code blocks. And in the end all I had to do was:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>rake generate
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>rake deploy
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>I love Octopress! I used to be a sad blogger and now I&#8217;m a happy
blogger. If you&#8217;re feeling like I felt - you should definitely give it
a shot. I&#8217;ll probably do a few follow up articles with some tips &amp;
tricks I&#8217;ve picked along the way with Octopress.</p>
