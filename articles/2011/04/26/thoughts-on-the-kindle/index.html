<div class="entry-content"><h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>I love reading - I love fiction, I love technical literature, I love
newspapers and magazines. I&#8217;m also a bit of old fashioned - I love the
feel and smell of paper, I love the ability to feel the pages. So it
took me quite some time to convince myself to buy one of the fabled
Amazon Kindle e-book reading devices. People often ask me what I think
about it and would I recommend them to buy one so I decided to write
down my thoughts here.</p>

<h2>The things I love about the Kindle</h2>

<h3>Typography</h3>

<p>The typography of the fiction books on the Kindle is simply amazing -
the fonts and the typesetting are close to perfect. The only thing
that is a bit off is the justification of some lines but this happens
very rarely. Most of the paper books I&#8217;ve recently bought have so
terrible typography that they simply appal me.</p>

<h3>Quality of images</h3>

<p>This one really surprised me - the images and photos look very good on
the Kindle(unless they are very big and have to be scaled down).</p>

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p>The navigation is outstanding - I think the idea to double the buttons
for forward/backward page was a brilliant one. The ability to skip
chapters and to easily navigate the table of contents is fairly handy
as well. Unfortunately not all mobi books are created with an useful
table of contents, but this is not a problem of the Kindle itself.</p>

<h3>Built-in dictionary</h3>

<p>Although my knowledge of English is considered quite considerable I&#8217;m
no native speaker and when I read fancy books from time to time I
encounter words I do not know. Having the built-in dictionary I can
just move the cursor to the word in question and I see its meaning
inline. This is so very cool!</p>

<h3>Weight &amp; size</h3>

<p>The Kindle is smaller and lighter than most paperbacks. And you can
carry literary hundreds of books on your kindle.</p>

<h3>Battery life</h3>

<p>Without the wireless the battery lasts for about a month&#8230;</p>

<h3>Amazon Kindle store</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s so easy to find and buy the books you want. You have the option
to buy something from the website and it will be automatically sent to
your Kindle or you can find and buy books from the Kindle itself if
you&#8217;re connected to the Internet.</p>

<h3>Free 3G</h3>

<p>The Amazon Kindle store is always at hand.</p>

<h3>The official lighted leather cover</h3>

<p>The
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kindle-Lighted-Leather-Display-Generation/dp/B003DZ165W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303826907&amp;sr=8-1">cover</a>
is made of leather and makes the Kindle appearance quite similar to
that of a real book. It also features LED light powered by the Kindle
itself with which you can easily read even in the darkest
places. Unfortunately it&#8217;s very expensive - it costs half as much as
the Kindle&#8230;</p>

<h3>E-ink screen</h3>

<p>Looks like a real book, immune to sunlight, great contrast.</p>

<h3>Collections</h3>

<p>You can organise your books into collections on various criteria.</p>

<h3>Ebooks are generally cheaper</h3>

<p>This is not true for all books(at least not yet). At least you save
the shipping expenses(if you have any).</p>

<h3>Highlights and sharing</h3>

<p>You can see passages other people highlighted as interesting and add
highlights and notes yourself. You can also tweet passages and stuff
like that. The Kindle is social&#8230;</p>

<h2>The things I don&#8217;t like</h2>

<h3>PDF support</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s so horrible I can barely describe it. Basically PDF are
unreadable and everyone that tell you otherwise is lying to you. The
Kindle DX is large enough to accommodate PDF I guess, but not the
normal Kindle.</p>

<h3>Formatting is terrible in technical books</h3>

<p>If you read a lot of books with diagrams, tables, source code, etc the
Kindle is not for you(or at least not for that task). Everything is
scrambled and confusing. Basically this and the previous item made me
buy an iPad 2 for reading PDFs and technical books.</p>

<h3>The web browser is mostly useless</h3>

<p>The Kindle has an experimental web browser, which is mostly useless
mainly due to the inherent limitation of the e-ink screen(such a
enormous refresh rate).</p>

<h3>Real page numbers</h3>

<p>The ability to cross reference paper pages with ebook pages was added
in a recent firmware update, but I haven&#8217;t seen any books that have
those page markers.</p>

<h3>Keyboard</h3>

<p>Mostly useless, probably a future version with some touchscreen
display would drop it. It just takes up valuable place.</p>

<h3>Screen is not touch sensitive</h3>

<p>In the first day I owned the devices I often tried to turn pages by
swiping the screen. I&#8217;m quite fond of touch screen interfaces and one
of those can make the Kindle even smaller.</p>

<h3>Magazines and newspapers are crippled</h3>

<p>Because the publishers have to pay some fee to amazon based on the
traffic they generate with their magazines/newspapers the Kindle
version are generally stripped down from a lot of images and other
content.</p>

<h3>No easy way to lend/borrow books</h3>

<p>Currently we have services like lendle.me, but they have a very
limited library. Soon the Kindle will have built-in lending support
and this will improve the situation immensely.</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>Basically the Kindle is the greatest thing after hot water for people
that read a lot of fiction books. Everyone else should consider buying
a tablet.</p>
