    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm mostly a Ruby on Rails developer these days and as such I'm pretty
fond of the <a href="http://slim-lang.com">Slim template language</a>. I've
always hated HTML + ERB, since that evil duo encourages all sorts of
ever practices and recently I've adopted Slim as a replacement for
my long time favourite ERB alternative - <a href="http://haml-lang.com">Haml</a>.</p>

<p>I won't discuss here the shortcomings of Haml vs Slim, but I'll share
with you the big advantage Haml has over Slim (for Emacs users at
least) - it has a pretty nice major editing mode for Emacs. Slim's
Emacs support on the other hand is rather iffy and is presently mostly
based on <code>haml-mode</code>. That will hopefully change soon, since recently
I've become a co-maintainer of
<a href="http://github.com/minad/emacs-slim">slim-mode</a> and I plan to improve
it as much as I can (currently I'm mostly working on precise
font-locking). Any help from interested parties is, naturally, most
welcome. I very much doubt that me and
<a href="https://github.com/minad">Daniel Mendler</a> are the only two people
dreaming of great Slim experience in Emacs. :-)</p>

<p>Let us together eliminate that big Haml advantage. :-)</p>

    <updated>2012-04-06T18:04:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://bbatsov.github.com/articles/2012/04/06/melpa-homebrew-emacs-edition</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I wrote an
<a href="http://batsov.com/articles/2012/02/19/package-management-in-emacs-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/">article about the state of package management in Emacs</a>. In
that article I pointed out that on the side of <a href="http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Package.el">package.el</a> too much
was riding on the poorly maintained Marmalade repo. Today
Marmalade went dark (again) and many people are wondering what to do
now. The answer is simple - start using <a href="http://melpa.milkbox.net/">MELPA</a> instead.</p>

<p>I was thinking of starting a project similar to Marmalade to alleviate
its problems, but then the MELPA project was brought to my
attention. This project follows the Homebrew (unofficial OSX package
manager) model of using simple GitHub collaboration to maintain and
grow a bunch of build recipes. In the case of MELPA, those recipes
show how to bundle upstream source packages into package.el-compliant
packages. The recipes can be tested locally by package authors, and
they are run hourly on the MELPA server to create an HTTP package
archive that Emacs users can simply add to their <code>'package-archives</code>
list. As <a href="http://technomancy.us">Phil Hagelberg</a> said - there's no reason to drag in
complicated dependencies like Node for something that's essentially a
pile of static files. MELPA on the other hand is written mostly in
Emacs Lisp and is thus much more comprehensible to casual Emacs hackers.</p>

<p>Most packages currently contained in MELPA are development snapshots,
but the project maintainer
<a href="https://github.com/milkypostman">Donald Curtis</a> and
<a href="http://www.sanityinc.com/">Steve Purcell</a> (aka <code>sanityinc</code>) are
working on extending the MELPA build scripts to support stable
packages, using upstream version tags.</p>

<p>Adding a new package to MELPA is as simple as adding a few lines of
code to the <code>pkglist</code> file in MELPA's source code repo:</p>

<p><code>cl
(name :url "&lt;repo url&gt;"
 :fetcher [git|svn|darcs|wiki]
 [:files ("&lt;file1&gt;", ...)])
</code></p>

<p>You simply have to fork the <a href="https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa">official repo</a>, modify <code>pkglist</code>, send a pull
request and <code>package.el</code> compatible packages will be built
automatically for you on MELPA's server (you can also build the
packages locally to test if everything is OK with your recipes). Sure it's not as easy as
submitting a package via a web UI, but it's a much more robust
approach. It also eliminates a common problem in Marmalade - there
only the original uploader (+ people selected by him) can update a
package. Often the original uploaders are very hard to find...</p>

<p>To use MELPA with Emacs 24 (or a recent version of <code>package.el</code>) just
add this to your <code>.emacs</code> (or equivalent):</p>

<p><code>cl
(add-to-list 'package-archives
'("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
</code></p>

<p>There's a lot more info regarding MELPA on its official website and
I'd rather not duplicate it here.</p>

<p>I would encourage package authors and users to investigate and
contribute to MELPA. I've already submitted a bunch of packages
there and rebased <a href="http://batsov.com/prelude">Emacs Prelude</a> to
use MELPA instead of Marmalade.</p>

<p>Together we can turn MELPA into the most extensive and robust community-supported
<code>package.el</code> repo! Emacs users deserve one of those :-)</p>

    <link href="http://bbatsov.github.com/articles/2012/03/26/wikemacs-the-other-emacs-wiki/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-26T11:23:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://bbatsov.github.com/articles/2012/03/26/wikemacs-the-other-emacs-wiki</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'd like to apologize to everyone insulted by my previous
posts. Contrary to popular belief I acknowledge EmacsWiki's
contribution to the Emacs community. Obviously many people are too
fond of its current format so I doubt that it will ever change
(considerably). I didn't mean to insult anyone, I just wanted to catch
your attention (which unfortunately requires harsher words from time to
time) and point it in the direction of the existing problems.</p>

<p>For the people that weren't happy with EmacsWiki - the ones that felt
my pain and were looking for a change I present
<a href="http://wikemacs.org">WikEmacs</a> (pronounced wikimacs). It's a
MediaWiki powered Emacs wiki, that will try to bring to the community
cleaner, leaner and more up-to-date documentation.</p>

<p>There are only a few guidelines for the contributors there:</p>

<ul>
<li>articles should be geared only towards the current and future
versions of Emacs (currently 23 and 24) for maintainability's sake.</li>
<li>articles should not copy Emacs's or extension's official
documentation - they should refer to it instead. An overview, some
nice pointers, tips and links - that seems like a good article,
doesn't it?</li>
<li>comments and questions should go to an article's discussion page</li>
</ul>


<p>File uploads are disabled on WikEmacs (but image file uploads will
probably be allowed soon) - it will never host Emacs extensions of any
sort.</p>

<p>There is a Google discussion group
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/wikemacs">here</a>
for more general questions regarding the wiki.</p>

<p>Our goal is not to copy over the 8500 articles available at
EmacsWiki. It's to provide a good road map for new users coming to
Emacs and enough helpful hints and tips for experienced users. Everyone
is welcome to join our efforts.</p>

<p>As far as short term goals go - have a look at the outlined structure
of the wiki (on its home page), pick a section that interests you and
create/extend/improve it. Our content is licensed with GNU's Free
Documentation License (which is compatible with Wikipedia's and
probably EmacsWiki's GPL2). Some nice blog articles about Emacs might
be converted to wiki articles with permission from their authors. You
might find <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/try">pandoc</a> useful to
automatically convert articles from other formats to MediaWiki markup
and <a href="https://launchpad.net/mediawiki-el">mediawiki.el</a> to edit
articles on wiki from the comfort of your beloved editor.</p>

<p>Thanks to the people that brought us the original EmacsWiki. Thanks to
everyone who supported the idea for the new wiki. Thanks in advance to
all future contributors.</p>

<p>Some people will undoubtedly see the birth of WikEmacs as a separatist move to fraction
the Emacs community. To them I'd like to say that few things in life
are as productive as competition. Obviously a lot of people willing to
contribute to a new wiki are unwilling to do so for EmacsWiki and vice
versa. This is not a contest and there will be no winner. I wish the
best of luck to EmacsWiki and its supporters. What I wish for is to give
our community the best source of documentation available and the
option to choose.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>Yesterday I wrote a highly
<a href="http://batsov.com/articles/2012/03/20/die-emacswiki/">controversial article about the state of the EmacsWiki</a>
and suggested a few things we can do to make things better. I got the
usual batch of hate mail and some remarks on the poor quality of my
English and writing style (which generally amuse me a lot). But I
got much more encouraging feedback from <strong>a lot</strong> of Emacs community
members. So here our story continues...</p>

<!--more -->


<h2>On The Essence of Things</h2>

<p>Some people accused me that I don't even know what I wiki is. To them
I'd like to say that a thing is not its dictionary/encyclopedia
definition. A thing is what it's perceived to be. People expect wiki
entries to look and behave like those found in MediaWiki or Confluence
and not like some mixture of a wiki, forum and irc conversation...</p>

<h2>A Word from Our Sponsor</h2>

<p>Alex wrote a
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/2012-03-20">public response on the EmacsWiki</a>
yesterday, that I'd first like to share (since probably more people
will see it here, than there). I publish it here with no alternations:</p>

<p><blockquote><p></p></p><p><p>Bozhidar Batsov is apparently very frustrated with Emacs Wiki. He<br/>seems to think that we should start over – use new software, add<br/>moderators, guidelines, and sorts of fancy stuff. My answer is the<br/>same as it was back in 2008 (http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MissionRant).</p></p><p><p>One of his ideas I actually agree with. "Submit documentation only to<br/>the official project pages." Absolutely. :)</p></p><p><p>Some ideas I am luke warm about: "package something on Marmalade…"<br/>Sure, why not? I have never used Marmalade, but I encourage you to<br/>improve the tools you use. There's also "don't respond to any bug<br/>requests regarding modified copies of your sources distributed via<br/>EmacsWiki." I also don't want to encourage bug reports on the<br/>wiki. Use the facilities built into Emacs to report bugs. But almost<br/>all of you know that.</p></p><p><p>But other ideas?</p></p><p><p>"Drop the current format of the wiki - use something standard like<br/>MediaWiki instead of OddMuse." How is reformatting the pages going to<br/>improve them?</p></p><p><p>"Drop all the articles about Emacs extensions." Just delete them? Are<br/>you at least going to rewrite them and move them to the appropriate<br/>project pages out there? Or are you just going to delete them? Taking<br/>away and not giving back?</p></p><p><p>"Drop all the extensions hosted there." Some of the old code has no<br/>other home. Some of the old code is here for the poor sods stuck with<br/>Emacs 20. Are you going to package them for ELPA or Marmalade or<br/>whatever you are going to suggest instead?</p></p><p><p>Some of you – like Drew Adams – keep their packages on the wiki. For<br/>those packages, I don't see any alternative. Are you going to maintain<br/>his software? Fix his bugs? Develop his features? Unless you are, I<br/>guess you can try and fork his stuff and keep it on whatever other<br/>system you want. But please don't suggest taking something away<br/>without giving something in return.</p></p><p><p>"Assemble a team of moderators." Indeed. Moderators! Where have you<br/>been hiding for the last ten years! Are you volunteering? I'm a bit<br/>wary regarding your deletionist tendencies. But perhaps you’d like to<br/>start with a new Table of Contents and new top-down menus where only<br/>the pages you personally vetted and checked are listed. That would be<br/>an awesome thing to do! Of course, there’s no need to delete anything<br/>in order for you to do this. Just arrange the stuff you like and do<br/>it.</p></p><p><p>In fact, in order to do it, just do it.</p></p><p><p>"Accept only articles about general Emacs usage and Emacs Lisp<br/>programming." How is that going to work – more deleting? I don't<br/>know... I don't think you understand where the value of Emacs Wiki<br/>comes from. Perhaps you should write a book about Emacs? Collect a<br/>team of authors and editors and deletionists, take a copy of the wiki,<br/>and just do it right.</p></p><p><p>Also, less hyperbole when posting... :P</p><footer><strong>Alex Schroeder</strong> <cite>Creator and Maintainer of EmacsWiki.org</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Here's my two cents on the letter:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The markup format hardly matters. A new wiki engine would give us
better structure of the wiki as whole (like separate discussion pages
for one).</p></li>
<li><p>Dropping it from the wiki doesn't mean we'll delete the code
forever. What I meant was - dump all the extensions to some archive
for the interested parties and remove them from the wiki. You're
basically putting words in my mouth.</p></li>
<li><p>We should care for the bad choices some people made (like Drew - all
my respect to his work). With so many free project hosting services I
don't feel we'll be taking something away and not giving an alternative.</p></li>
<li><p>No, I don't volunteer. Not for this format of the wiki. But I do
volunteer for an alternative matching the outline I've suggested.</p></li>
<li><p>Mocking me is not right response, you know. The problem exists, you
fail to acknowledge it, but I don't care that much.</p></li>
<li><p>Alex calls it hyperbole, I call it the simple truth (and many others
would second me).</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>The Plan</h2>

<p>Many people commented that my post is not worth a damn if I'm not
willing to back it with action. I'm sad to disappoint my critics - but
I'll willing to go the whole nine yards on this one. Here's the
outline of my proposal for a new wiki:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use <a href="http://moinmo.in/">MoinMoin</a> as the wiki engine. It's written in Python and
it's GPL software. It doesn't use a database, it's featureful and
mature. It's successfully used by Debian and Ubuntu (and many other
respectable software organizations). I'm against using a Git backed
systems since it will increase the entry bar for user
participation. I'm even more against the use of a custom platform
developed specially to serve as the EmacsWiki.</p></li>
<li><p>I'll pay for the hosting and the new domain and set up the wiki
initially. I'd suggest that the new project begins with the domain
emacswiki.net or emacswiki.info and eventually we'll assume the old
emacswiki.org domain as well (should the new wiki be successful
enough). Suggestions for another name are welcome in the comments
section.</p></li>
<li><p>I and anyone willing to lend a hand will pick the articles worth
saving from the EmacsWiki and migrate them to the new one. I and
anyone willing to serve as moderator will monitor new contributions
afterwards.</p></li>
<li><p>Wiki entries will have a more or less standard structure and will
adhere and community established guidelines.</p></li>
<li><p>The old EmacsWiki will eventually be retired to another domain such
as old.emacswiki.org (or similar) for historic purposes and benefit of
users of old Emacs versions.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>It this good enough for you to call it an action plan? Comments on it
are most welcome!</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>I'm sorry that I'm the guy that has to break the terrible news to all of
the delusional EmacsWiki supporters out there - <em>It's not
special. It's not a beautiful or unique snowflake. It's the same
decaying wiki matter like some many else.</em> I'm sorry for my terrible
English and my lack of good manners. I'm sorry I'm willing do to
something while so many of you are just whining and ignoring the
existing problems.</p>

<p>I think as a member of the Emacs community I've shown my worth so far
and I'll willing to do even more. But I cannot carry out such a
massive undertaking on my own. I encourage everyone serious about
helping out to comment the article (here, not on reddit or hacker
news) or send me a personal email.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>The new wiki is now available at
<a href="http://wikemacs.org">http://wikemacs.org</a>. It's using MediaWiki (it
turned out it had several nice advantages over MoinMoin).</p>
