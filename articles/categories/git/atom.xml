    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you have applications, whose configuration is as complex as that
of Emacs it’s always a good idea to store that configuration under
version control so you can easily share it between multiple
computers. You can always set up some version control system yourself,
but it’s a lot more convenient (and much more reliable) to use an
already existing code hosting solution such a GitHub. I have created a
small repo there housing my humble Emacs configuration(.emacs, some
custom stuff) and this way I can easily access it on all the computers
that I happen to be working on.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>At some point my custom configuration grew into what is known today as
the <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Emacs Prelude</a>.</p>
