    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I haven’t posted anything lately, but I just received my brand new
<strong>Das Keyboard</strong> and now I simply can’t stop typing. Recently I’ve been
going through some effective technics to implement popular design
patterns and I was surprised to see how few people where aware of
them. For example since Java 5 the best way to implement the Singleton
pattern is simply to use an enum like this:</p>

<p>``` java
public enum SomeClass {</p>

<pre><code>INSTANCE;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>This is possible due to the fact that in Java(unlike in C++ and C#)
enums are full-blown classes(although they do not support features
like inheritance for example). You get an added bonus when using an
enum class – you do not have to worry about serialization – this is
handled for you behind the scenes.</p>

<p>And this is how one should implement the Singleton pattern in Ruby:</p>

<p>``` ruby
require 'singleton'</p>

<p>class Some
  include Singleton
end
```</p>

<p>Through the magic of Ruby’s mix-ins you get a private constructor for
your class and an instance method with which you can obtain a
reference to the single instance of the class. And best of all –
because this library has undergone a substantial degree of testing it
is pretty much bulletproof. Things hardly get simpler than that.</p>
