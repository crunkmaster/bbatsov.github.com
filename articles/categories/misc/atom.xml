    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been quite a while since my last blog post. And there hasn't been that
much action on the open-source projects I happen to maintain
either. The reason for this is quite simple - recently I've joined the
ranks of the social trading start-up <a href="http://tradeo.com">Tradeo</a> and
things have been crazy at work ever since.</p>

<p>While this is without a doubt my coolest job to date, it's also the
most demanding. Anyways - just wanted to let you know I'm doing OK and
I plan to resume my usual blogging and open-source coding duties soon.</p>
